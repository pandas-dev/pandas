IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the numpy C-extensions failed. This error can happen for
many reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was
installed.
{bad_c_module_info}
We have compiled some common reasons and troubleshooting tips at:

    https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html

Please note and check the following:

  * The Python version is: Python {major}.{minor} from "{sys.executable}"
  * The NumPy version is: "{__version__}"

and make sure that they are the versions you expect.

Please carefully study the information and documentation linked above.
This is unlikely to be a NumPy issue but will be caused by a bad install
or environment on your machine.
