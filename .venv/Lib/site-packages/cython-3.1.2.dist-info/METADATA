The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
easy as Python itself.  Cython is a source code translator based on Pyrex_,
but supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python
code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional
static typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and
declare fast C types on variables and class attributes.  This allows the
compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external
C/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of
Python code.

The newest Cython release can always be downloaded from https://cython.org/.
Unpack the tarball or zip file, enter the directory, and then run::

    pip install .

Note that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms that are not
covered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI *and* the pure Python wheel
that we provide is not used, it is substantially faster than a full source build
to install an uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with::

    NO_CYTHON_COMPILE=true pip install .

==================

Bugs fixed
----------

* Attribute lookups failed on the ``bool`` builtin type.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6905)

* Type checks on or-ed union types could incorrectly return false.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6420)

* Negative list indexing could accidentally wrap around twice in PyPy and the Limited API.

* Iterating over literal sequences with starred (unpacked) items could infer a wrong
  type for the loop variable and fail to assign the values.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6924)

* Calls to C functions taking exception types failed to check for a `None` argument.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6420)

* Fused functions had an incorrect ``__module__`` attribute.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6897)

* The type of Cython implemented functions had an incorrect ``__module__`` attribute.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6841)

* Errors while indexing into ``bytearray`` or ``str`` in ``nogil`` sections could crash.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6947)

* The C++11 ``<type_traits>`` header was included regardless of the C++ version.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6896)

* ``PyDict_GetItemStringRef()`` was accidentally used in older Limited API versions.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6914)

* ``abort()`` was used but not always available in the Limited API.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6918)

  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6938)

* Embedded function signatures were not always separated from the existing docstring.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6904)

* ``numpy.math`` was missing from ``Cython/Includes/`` and could not be cimported.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6859)

* Some tests were adapted for NumPy 2.x.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6898)
