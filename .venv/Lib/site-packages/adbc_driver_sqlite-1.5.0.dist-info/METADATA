# ADBC SQLite Driver for Python

This package contains bindings for the [ADBC SQLite driver][sqlite], using the
[driver manager][driver-manager] to provide a [DBAPI 2.0/PEP
249-compatible][dbapi] interface on top.

[dbapi]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/
[driver-manager]: https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/python/driver_manager.html
[sqlite]: https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/driver/sqlite.html

## Example

```python
import adbc_driver_sqlite.dbapi

with adbc_driver_sqlite.dbapi.connect() as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT 1")
        print(cur.fetch_arrow_table())
```

## Building

Dependencies: a build of the SQLite driver, and the
`adbc-driver-manager` Python package.  Optionally, install PyArrow to
use the DBAPI 2.0-compatible interface.

Set the environment variable `ADBC_SQLITE_LIBRARY` to the path to
`libadbc_driver_sqlite.{dll,dylib,so}` before running `pip install`.

```
# If not already installed
pip install -e ../adbc_driver_manager

export ADBC_SQLITE_LIBRARY=/path/to/libadbc_driver_sqlite.so
pip install --no-deps -e .
```

For users building from the arrow-adbc source repository, you can alternately use CMake to manage library dependencies and set environment variables for you. Assuming you specify ``-DADBC_DRIVER_SQLITE=ON`` you can also add ``-DADBC_BUILD_PYTHON=ON`` to define a ``python`` target.

For example, assuming you run cmake from the project root:

```shell
cmake -S c -B build --preset debug -DADBC_BUILD_PYTHON=ON -DADBC_DRIVER_SQLITE=ON
cmake --build build --target python
```

will properly build and install the Python library for you.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the
general build process.

## Testing

To run the tests, use pytest:

```shell
$ pytest -vvx
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the
general test process.
