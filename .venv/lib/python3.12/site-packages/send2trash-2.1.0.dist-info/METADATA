==================================================
Send2Trash -- Send files to trash on all platforms
==================================================

Send2Trash is a small package that sends files to the Trash (or Recycle Bin) *natively* and on
*all platforms*. On OS X, it uses native ``FSMoveObjectToTrashSync`` Cocoa calls or can use pyobjc 
with NSFileManager. On Windows, it uses native ``IFileOperation`` call if on Vista or newer and 
pywin32 is installed or falls back to ``SHFileOperation`` calls. On other platforms, if `PyGObject`_ 
and `GIO`_ are available, it will use this.  Otherwise, it will fallback to its own implementation of 
the `trash specifications from freedesktop.org`_.

``ctypes`` is used to access native libraries, so no compilation is necessary.

Send2Trash supports Python 3 (versions before 2.x support Python 2).

Status: Additional Help Welcome
-------------------------------

Additional help is welcome for supporting this package.  Specifically help with the OSX and Linux 
issues and fixes would be most appreciated.

Installation
------------

You can download it with pip:

    python -m pip install -U send2trash

To install with pywin32 or pyobjc required specify the extra `nativeLib`:

    python -m pip install -U send2trash[nativeLib]

or download the source from https://github.com/arsenetar/send2trash and install it with:

    python -m pip install -e .

On systems where Python enforces PEP 668 (e.g., recent Linux distributions),
installing packages into the system Python may be restricted.
Use a virtual environment:

    python -m venv .venv

    GNU/Linux / macOS:

        source .venv/bin/activate

    Windows:

        .venv\Scripts\activate

Usage
-----

>>> from send2trash import send2trash
>>> send2trash('some_file')
>>> send2trash(['some_file1', 'some_file2'])

On Freedesktop platforms (Linux, BSD, etc.), you may not be able to efficiently
trash some files. In these cases, an exception ``send2trash.TrashPermissionError``
is raised, so that the application can handle this case. This inherits from
``PermissionError``. Specifically, this affects
files on a different device to the user's home directory, where the root of the
device does not have a ``.Trash`` directory, and we don't have permission to
create a ``.Trash-$UID`` directory.

For any other problem, ``OSError`` is raised.
