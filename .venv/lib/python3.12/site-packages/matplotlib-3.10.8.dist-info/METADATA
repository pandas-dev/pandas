           SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
           -----------------------------------------------------------
         
           PREAMBLE
           The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
           development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
           efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
           open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
           with others.
         
           The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
           redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
           fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
           redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
           names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
           however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
           requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
           to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
         
           DEFINITIONS
           "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
           Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
           include source files, build scripts and documentation.
         
           "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
           copyright statement(s).
         
           "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
           distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
         
           "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
           or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
           Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
           new environment.
         
           "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
           writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
         
           PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
           Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
           a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
           redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
           Software, subject to the following conditions:
         
           1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
           in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
         
           2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
           redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
           contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
           included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
           in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
           binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
         
           3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
           Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
           Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
           presented to the users.
         
           4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
           Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
           Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
           Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
           permission.
         
           5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
           must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
           distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
           remain under this license does not apply to any document created
           using the Font Software.

           not met.

         Name: JSXTools resize observer
         Files: 
         Description: Minimal polyfill for the ResizeObserver API
         License: CC0-1.0
           # CC0 1.0 Universal
         
           ## Statement of Purpose
         
           The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
           exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
           subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
           authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
         
           Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
           purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
           (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
           infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
           redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
           including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
           to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
           production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
           greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
           others.
         
           For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
           additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
           Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
           and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
           publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
           Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
           effect of CC0 on those rights.
         
           1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
              protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
              Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
              to, the following:
              1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
                 and translate a Work;
              2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
              3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
                 depicted in a Work;
              4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
                 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
              5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
                 a Work;
              6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
                 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
                 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
              7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
                 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
                 thereof.
         
           2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
              applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
              unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
              and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
              known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
              action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
              duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
              makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
              to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
              such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
              termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
              enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
              Statement of Purpose.
         
           3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
              judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
              shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
              Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
              Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
              royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
              irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
              Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
              maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
              shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
              Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
              invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
              ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
              such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
              of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
              assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
              in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
         
           4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
              1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
                 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
              2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
                 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
                 otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
                 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
                 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
                 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
                 extent permissible under applicable law.
              3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
                 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
                 limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
                 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
                 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
              4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
                 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
                 CC0 or use of the Work.

           Fonts or subset of the Fonts.
         
              4. You may also (a) add glyphs or characters to the Fonts, or modify 
           the shape of existing glyphs, so long as the base set of glyphs is not 
           removed and (b) delete glyphs or characters from the Fonts, provided 
           that the resulting font set is distributed with the following 
           disclaimer: "This [name] font does not include all the Unicode points 
           covered in the STIX Fonts-TM set but may include others." In each case, 
           the name used to denote the resulting font set shall not include the 
           term "STIX" or any similar term.
         
              5. You may charge a fee in connection with the distribution of the 
           Font Software, provided that no copy of one or more of the individual 
           Font typefaces that form the STIX Fonts-TM set may be sold by itself.

           David H. Munro wrote Yorick and Gist.  Berkeley Yacc (byacc) generated
           the Yorick parser.  The routines in Math are from LAPACK and FFTPACK;
           MathC contains C translations by David H. Munro.  The algorithms for
           Yorick's random number generator and several special functions in
           Yorick/include were taken from Numerical Recipes by Press, et. al.,
           although the Yorick implementations are unrelated to those in
           Numerical Recipes.  A small amount of code in Gist was adapted from
