"""Abstractions over S3's upload/download operations.

This module provides high level abstractions for efficient
uploads/downloads.  It handles several things for the user:

* Automatically switching to multipart transfers when
  a file is over a specific size threshold
* Uploading/downloading a file in parallel
* Throttling based on max bandwidth
* Progress callbacks to monitor transfers
* Retries.  While botocore handles retries for streaming uploads,
  it is not possible for it to handle retries for streaming
  downloads.  This module handles retries for both cases so
  you don't need to implement any retry logic yourself.

This module has a reasonable set of defaults.  It also allows you
to configure many aspects of the transfer process including:

* Multipart threshold size
* Max parallel downloads
* Max bandwidth
* Socket timeouts
* Retry amounts

There is no support for s3->s3 multipart copies at this
time.


.. _ref_s3transfer_usage:

Usage
=====

The simplest way to use this module is:

.. code-block:: python

    client = boto3.client('s3', 'us-west-2')
    transfer = S3Transfer(client)
    # Upload /tmp/myfile to s3://bucket/key
    transfer.upload_file('/tmp/myfile', 'bucket', 'key')

    # Download s3://bucket/key to /tmp/myfile
    transfer.download_file('bucket', 'key', '/tmp/myfile')

The ``upload_file`` and ``download_file`` methods also accept
``**kwargs``, which will be forwarded through to the corresponding
client operation.  Here are a few examples using ``upload_file``::

    # Making the object public
    transfer.upload_file('/tmp/myfile', 'bucket', 'key',
                         extra_args={'ACL': 'public-read'})

    # Setting metadata
    transfer.upload_file('/tmp/myfile', 'bucket', 'key',
                         extra_args={'Metadata': {'a': 'b', 'c': 'd'}})

    # Setting content type
    transfer.upload_file('/tmp/myfile.json', 'bucket', 'key',
                         extra_args={'ContentType': "application/json"})


The ``S3Transfer`` class also supports progress callbacks so you can
provide transfer progress to users.  Both the ``upload_file`` and
``download_file`` methods take an optional ``callback`` parameter.
Here's an example of how to print a simple progress percentage
to the user:

.. code-block:: python

    class ProgressPercentage(object):
        def __init__(self, filename):
            self._filename = filename
            self._size = float(os.path.getsize(filename))
            self._seen_so_far = 0
            self._lock = threading.Lock()

        def __call__(self, bytes_amount):
            # To simplify we'll assume this is hooked up
            # to a single filename.
            with self._lock:
                self._seen_so_far += bytes_amount
                percentage = (self._seen_so_far / self._size) * 100
                sys.stdout.write(
                    "\r%s  %s / %s  (%.2f%%)" % (self._filename, self._seen_so_far,
                                                 self._size, percentage))
                sys.stdout.flush()


    transfer = S3Transfer(boto3.client('s3', 'us-west-2'))
    # Upload /tmp/myfile to s3://bucket/key and print upload progress.
    transfer.upload_file('/tmp/myfile', 'bucket', 'key',
                         callback=ProgressPercentage('/tmp/myfile'))



You can also provide a TransferConfig object to the S3Transfer
object that gives you more fine grained control over the
transfer.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

    client = boto3.client('s3', 'us-west-2')
    config = TransferConfig(
        multipart_threshold=8 * 1024 * 1024,
        max_concurrency=10,
        num_download_attempts=10,
    )
    transfer = S3Transfer(client, config)
    transfer.upload_file('/tmp/foo', 'bucket', 'key')
