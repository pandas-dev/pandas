# PDEP-18: Nullable Object Dtype for Pandas

## Abstract

This proposal outlines the introduction of a nullable object
dtype to the pandas library. The goal is to provide a
dedicated dtype for handling arbitrary Python objects with
consistent missing value semantics using `pd.NA`. Unlike the
traditional `object` dtype which lacks robust missing data
handling, this new nullable dtype will add clarity and
consistency in representing missing or undefined values
within object arrays.

## Motivation

Currently, the `object` dtype in pandas is a catch-all for
heterogeneous Python objects, but it does not enforce any
particular missing-value semantics. As pandas has evolved to
include extension types (like `string[python]`, `Int64`, or
`boolean`), there is a clear benefit in extending these
improvements to the object datatype. A nullable object dtype
would help:
- **Consistency**: Enforce a uniform approach to managing
missing values with `pd.NA` across all dtypes.
- **Interoperability**: Enable cleaner and more predictable
behavior when performing operations on data previously
stored as generic objects.
- **Clarity**: Help users distinguish between truly “object”
data and data that is better represented by a nullable
container supporting missing values.

This proposal is driven by frequent community discussions
and development efforts that aim to unify missing value
handling across pandas data types.

## Detailed Proposal

### Definition

The proposal introduces a new extension type, tentatively
named `"object_nullable"`, that stores an underlying array
of Python objects alongside a boolean mask that indicates
missing (i.e., `pd.NA`) values. The API should mimic that of
existing extension arrays, ensuring that missing value
propagation, casting, and arithmetic comparisons (where
applicable) behave consistently with other nullable types.

### Key Features
1. **Consistent Missing Value Semantics**:
    - Missing entries will be represented by `pd.NA`,
    ensuring compatibility with pandas nullable dtypes that
    use `pd.NA` as the missing value indicator as well as
    the experimental `ArrowDType`.
    - Operations that encounter missing values will handle
    `pd.NA` uniformly consistent with other pandas nullable
    dtypes that use `pd.NA` as the missing value indicator.
2. **Underlying Data Storage**:
    - The core data structure will consist of a NumPy array
    of Python objects and an associated boolean mask. (not
    so different from the current `object` backed nullable
    string array variant that uses `pd.NA` as the missing
    value.)
    - Consideration should be given to performance, ensuring
    that operations remain as vectorized as possible despite
    the inherent overhead of handling Python objects.
3. **API Integration**:
    - The new dtype will implement the ExtensionArray
    interface.
    - Methods such as `astype`, `isna`, `fillna`, and
    element-wise operations are already defined to respect
    missing values in the other pandas nullable dtypes.
    - All operations on a nullable object array will return
    a pandas nullable array except where requested, such as
    `astype`. Methods like `fillna` would still return a
    nullable object array even though there are no missing
    values to avoid introducing mixed-propagation behavior.
    - Ensure compatibility with pandas functions, like
    groupby, concatenation, and merging, where the semantics
    of missing values are critical.
4. **Transition and Interoperability**:
    - Users should be able to convert from the legacy object
    dtype to object_nullable using a constructor or an
    explicit method (e.g., `pd.array(old_array,
    dtype="object_nullable")`) using the existing api.
    - Operations on existing pandas nullable dtypes that
    would normally produce an object dtype should be updated
    (or made configurable as a transition path) to yield
    "object_nullable" in all cases even when missing values
    are not present to avoid introducing mixed-propagation
    behavior.
    - `ArrowDType` does not offer an `object` dtype for
    heterogeneous Python objects and therefore a user
    requesting arrow dtypes could be given "object_nullable"
    arrays where appropriate to avoid mixed `pd.NA`/`np.nan`
    semantics when using `dtype_backend="pyarrow"`.


### Implementation Considerations
1. **Performance**:
    - Handling arbitrary Python objects is inherently slower
    than operations on native numerical types.
    - Expanding the EA interface to 2D is outside the scope
    of this PDEP.

2. **Backward Compatibility**:
    - Existing code that uses the traditional object dtype
    should not break. (Making the pandas nullable object
    dtype the default is not part of this proposal and would
    be discussed in conjunction with moving the other pandas
    nullable dtypes to be default.)
    - Existing code that uses the pandas nullable dtypes
    should not break without warnings, even though they are
    considered experimental, as these dtypes have been
    available to users for a long time. The new dtype can be
    offered as an opt-in feature initially.
3. **Testing and Documentation**:
    - Extensive tests will be required to validate behavior
    against edge cases.
    - Updated documentation should explain differences
    between the legacy object dtype and object_nullable,
    including examples and migration tips.
4. **Community Feedback**:
    - Continuous discussions on GitHub, mailing lists, and
    related channels will inform refinements. The nullable
    object dtype should be available as opt-in for at least
    2 minor versions to allow sufficient time for feedback
    before the return types of the existing pandas nullable
    dtypes are changed.

## Alternatives Considered
- Continuing with the Legacy Object Dtype:
    - Retaining the ambiguous missing value semantics of the
    legacy object dtype does not provide a robust and
    consistent solution, aligning with the design of other
    extension arrays.
    - Not having a nullable object dtype could potentially
    be a blocker for a potential future nullable by default
    policy.

## Drawbacks and Future Directions
1. **Overhead Cost**:
The additional memory required for a boolean mask and
possible performance penalties in highly heterogeneous
arrays are acknowledged trade-offs.
2. **Integration Complexity**:
Ensuring seamless integration with the full suite of pandas
functionality may reveal edge cases that require careful
handling.
3. **Incompatibility**:
The existing object array can hold any python object, even
`pd.NA` itself. The proposed nullable object array will be
unable to hold `np.nan`, `None` or `pd.NaT` as these will be
considered missing in the constructors and other conversions
when following the existing API for the other nullable
types. Users will not be able to round-trip between the
legacy and nullable object dtypes.

## Conclusion
Introducing a nullable object dtype in pandas will offer a
clearer semantic for missing values and align the behavior
of object arrays with other nullable types. This proposal is
aimed at fostering discussion and soliciting community
feedback to refine the design and implementation roadmap.
