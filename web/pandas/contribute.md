# Contribute to pandas

_pandas_ is and always will be **free**. To make de development sustainable, we need _pandas_ users, corporate
or individual, to support the development by providing their time and money.

You can find more information about current developers in the [team page](about/team.html),

Financial contributions will mainly be used to advance in the [pandas roadmap](about/roadmap.html).
