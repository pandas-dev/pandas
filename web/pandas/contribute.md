# Contribute to pandas

_pandas_ is and will always be **free**. To make the development sustainable, we need _pandas_ users, corporate
and individual, to support the development by providing their time and money.

You can find more information about current developers in the [team page]({{ base_url }}about/team.html),
and about current sponsors in the [sponsors page]({{ base_url }}about/sponsors.html).

            pandas depends on companies and institutions using the software to support its development. Hiring
            people to work on pandas, or letting existing employees to contribute to the
            software. Or sponsoring pandas with funds, so the project can hire people to
            progress on the <a href="{{ base_url }}about/roadmap.html">pandas roadmap</a>.
