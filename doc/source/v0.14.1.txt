API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~






- All ``offsets`` suppports ``normalize`` keyword to specify whether ``offsets.apply``, ``rollforward`` and ``rollback`` resets time (hour, minute, etc) or not (default ``False``, preserves time) (:issue:`7156`)


  .. ipython:: python

   import pandas.tseries.offsets as offsets

   day = offsets.Day()
   day.apply(Timestamp('2014-01-01 09:00'))

   day = offsets.Day(normalize=True)
   day.apply(Timestamp('2014-01-01 09:00'))

- Improved inference of datetime/timedelta with mixed null objects. Regression from 0.13.1 in interpretation of an object Index
  with all null elements (:issue:`7431`)

- Openpyxl now raises a ValueError on construction of the openpyxl writer
  instead of warning on pandas import (:issue:`7284`).

- For ``StringMethods.extract``, when no match is found, the result - only
  containing ``NaN`` values - now also has ``dtype=object`` instead of
  ``float`` (:issue:`7242`)

- `StringMethods`` now work on empty Series (:issue:`7242`)
- ``Period`` objects no longer raise a ``TypeError`` when compared using ``==``
  with another object that *isn't* a ``Period``. See :issue:`7376`. Instead
  when comparing a ``Period`` with another object using ``==`` if the other
  object isn't a ``Period`` ``False`` is returned.

- Bug in ``.loc`` performing fallback integer indexing with ``object`` dtype indices (:issue:`7496`)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~



- Add ``dropna`` argument to ``value_counts`` and ``nunique`` (:issue:`5569`).


















- Tests for basic reading of public S3 buckets now exist (:issue:`7281`).
- ``read_html`` now sports an ``encoding`` argument that is passed to the
  underlying parser library. You can use this to read non-ascii encoded web
  pages (:issue:`7323`).

- Support for dateutil timezones, which can now be used in the same way as
  pytz timezones across pandas. (:issue:`4688`)

  .. ipython:: python

     rng = date_range('3/6/2012 00:00', periods=10, freq='D',
                      tz='dateutil/Europe/London')
     rng.tz

  See :ref:`the docs <timeseries.timezone>`.

- Implemented ``sem`` (standard error of the mean) operation for ``Series``,
  ``DataFrame``, ``Panel``, and ``Groupby`` (:issue:`6897`)
- Add ``nlargest`` and ``nsmallest`` to the ``Series`` ``groupby`` whitelist,
  which means you can now use these methods on a ``SeriesGroupBy`` object
  (:issue:`7053`).



- All offsets ``apply``, ``rollforward`` and ``rollback`` can now handle ``np.datetime64``, previously results in ``ApplyTypeError`` (:issue:`7452`)

- ``Period`` and ``PeriodIndex`` can contain ``NaT`` in its values (:issue:`7485`)


.. _whatsnew_0141.performance:

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Improvements in dtype inference for numeric operations involving yielding performance gains for dtypes: ``int64``, ``timedelta64``, ``datetime64`` (:issue:`7223`)
- Improvements in Series.transform for significant performance gains (:issue:`6496`)
- Improvements in DataFrame.transform with ufuncs and built-in grouper functions for signifcant performance gains (:issue:`7383`)







Experimental
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pandas.io.data.Options`` has gained a ``get_all_data method``, and now consistently returns a multi-indexed ``DataFrame`` (:issue:`5602`). See :ref:`the docs<remote_data.yahoo_options>`

  .. ipython:: python

     from pandas.io.data import Options
     aapl = Options('aapl', 'yahoo')
     data = aapl.get_all_data()
     data.iloc[0:5, 0:5]
