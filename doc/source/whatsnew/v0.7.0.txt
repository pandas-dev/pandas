API Changes to integer indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the potentially riskiest API changes in 0.7.0, but also one of the most
important, was a complete review of how **integer indexes** are handled with
regard to label-based indexing. Here is an example:

.. ipython:: python

    s = Series(randn(10), index=range(0, 20, 2))
    s
    s[0]
    s[2]
    s[4]

This is all exactly identical to the behavior before. However, if you ask for a
key **not** contained in the Series, in versions 0.6.1 and prior, Series would
*fall back* on a location-based lookup. This now raises a ``KeyError``:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [2]: s[1]
   KeyError: 1

This change also has the same impact on DataFrame:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [3]: df = DataFrame(randn(8, 4), index=range(0, 16, 2))

   In [4]: df
       0        1       2       3
   0   0.88427  0.3363 -0.1787  0.03162
   2   0.14451 -0.1415  0.2504  0.58374
   4  -1.44779 -0.9186 -1.4996  0.27163
   6  -0.26598 -2.4184 -0.2658  0.11503
   8  -0.58776  0.3144 -0.8566  0.61941
   10  0.10940 -0.7175 -1.0108  0.47990
   12 -1.16919 -0.3087 -0.6049 -0.43544
   14 -0.07337  0.3410  0.0424 -0.16037

   In [5]: df.ix[3]
   KeyError: 3

In order to support purely integer-based indexing, the following methods have
been added:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Method","Description"
    :widths: 40,60

	``Series.iget_value(i)``, Retrieve value stored at location ``i``
	``Series.iget(i)``, Alias for ``iget_value``
	``DataFrame.irow(i)``, Retrieve the ``i``-th row
	``DataFrame.icol(j)``, Retrieve the ``j``-th column
	"``DataFrame.iget_value(i, j)``", Retrieve the value at row ``i`` and column ``j``

API tweaks regarding label-based slicing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Label-based slicing using ``ix`` now requires that the index be sorted
(monotonic) **unless** both the start and endpoint are contained in the index:

.. ipython:: python

   s = Series(randn(6), index=list('gmkaec'))
   s

Then this is OK:

.. ipython:: python

   s.ix['k':'e']

But this is not:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [12]: s.ix['b':'h']
   KeyError 'b'

If the index had been sorted, the "range selection" would have been possible:

.. ipython:: python

   s2 = s.sort_index()
   s2
   s2.ix['b':'h']

Changes to Series ``[]`` operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As as notational convenience, you can pass a sequence of labels or a label
slice to a Series when getting and setting values via ``[]`` (i.e. the
``__getitem__`` and ``__setitem__`` methods). The behavior will be the same as
passing similar input to ``ix`` **except in the case of integer indexing**:

.. ipython:: python

   s = Series(randn(6), index=list('acegkm'))
   s
   s[['m', 'a', 'c', 'e']]
   s['b':'l']
   s['c':'k']

In the case of integer indexes, the behavior will be exactly as before
(shadowing ``ndarray``):

.. ipython:: python

   s = Series(randn(6), index=range(0, 12, 2))
   s[[4, 0, 2]]
   s[1:5]

If you wish to do indexing with sequences and slicing on an integer index with
label semantics, use ``ix``.

Other API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The deprecated ``LongPanel`` class has been completely removed

- If ``Series.sort`` is called on a column of a DataFrame, an exception will
  now be raised. Before it was possible to accidentally mutate a DataFrame's
  column by doing ``df[col].sort()`` instead of the side-effect free method
  ``df[col].order()`` (:issue:`316`)

- Miscellaneous renames and deprecations which will (harmlessly) raise
  ``FutureWarning``

- ``drop`` added as an optional parameter to ``DataFrame.reset_index`` (:issue:`699`)

Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`Cythonized GroupBy aggregations <groupby.aggregate.cython>` no longer
  presort the data, thus achieving a significant speedup (:issue:`93`).  GroupBy
  aggregations with Python functions significantly sped up by clever
  manipulation of the ndarray data type in Cython (:issue:`496`).
- Better error message in DataFrame constructor when passed column labels
  don't match data (:issue:`497`)
- Substantially improve performance of multi-GroupBy aggregation when a
  Python function is passed, reuse ndarray object in Cython (:issue:`496`)
- Can store objects indexed by tuples and floats in HDFStore (:issue:`492`)
- Don't print length by default in Series.to_string, add `length` option (:issue:`489`)
- Improve Cython code for multi-groupby to aggregate without having to sort
  the data (:issue:`93`)
- Improve MultiIndex reindexing speed by storing tuples in the MultiIndex,
  test for backwards unpickling compatibility
- Improve column reindexing performance by using specialized Cython take
  function
- Further performance tweaking of Series.__getitem__ for standard use cases
- Avoid Index dict creation in some cases (i.e. when getting slices, etc.),
  regression from prior versions
- Friendlier error message in setup.py if NumPy not installed
- Use common set of NA-handling operations (sum, mean, etc.) in Panel class
  also (:issue:`536`)
- Default name assignment when calling ``reset_index`` on DataFrame with a
  regular (non-hierarchical) index (:issue:`476`)
- Use Cythonized groupers when possible in Series/DataFrame stat ops with
  ``level`` parameter passed (:issue:`545`)
- Ported skiplist data structure to C to speed up ``rolling_median`` by about
  5-10x in most typical use cases (:issue:`374`)
