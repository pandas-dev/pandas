v0.16.1 (April ??, 2015)
------------------------

This is a minor bug-fix release from 0.16.0 and includes a a large number of
bug fixes along several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements.
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Highlights include:

- Support for a ``CategoricalIndex``, a category based index, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0161`.enhancements.categoricalindex>`

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``StringMethods.capitalize()`` and ``swapcase`` which behave as the same as standard ``str`` (:issue:`9766`)
- Added ``StringMethods`` (.str accessor) to ``Index`` (:issue:`9068`)

  The `.str` accessor is now available for both `Series` and `Index`.

  .. ipython:: python

     idx = Index([' jack', 'jill ', ' jesse ', 'frank'])
     idx.str.strip()

  One special case for the `.str` accessor on `Index` is that if a string method returns `bool`, the `.str` accessor
  will return a `np.array` instead of a boolean `Index` (:issue:`8875`). This enables the following expression
  to work naturally:


  .. ipython:: python

     idx = Index(['a1', 'a2', 'b1', 'b2'])
     s = Series(range(4), index=idx)
     s
     idx.str.startswith('a')
     s[s.index.str.startswith('a')]

- ``DataFrame.mask()`` and ``Series.mask()`` now support same keywords as ``where`` (:issue:`8801`)

- ``drop`` function can now accept ``errors`` keyword to suppress ValueError raised when any of label does not exist in the target data. (:issue:`6736`)

  .. ipython:: python

    df = DataFrame(np.random.randn(3, 3), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])
    df.drop(['A', 'X'], axis=1, errors='ignore')

- Allow conversion of values with dtype ``datetime64`` or ``timedelta64`` to strings using ``astype(str)`` (:issue:`9757`)
- ``get_dummies`` function now accepts ``sparse`` keyword.  If set to ``True``, the return ``DataFrame`` is sparse, e.g. ``SparseDataFrame``. (:issue:`8823`)
- ``Period`` now accepts ``datetime64`` as value input. (:issue:`9054`)

- Allow timedelta string conversion when leading zero is missing from time definition, ie `0:00:00` vs `00:00:00`. (:issue:`9570`)
- Allow Panel.shift with ``axis='items'`` (:issue:`9890`)

- Trying to write an excel file now raises ``NotImplementedError`` if the ``DataFrame`` has a ``MultiIndex`` instead of writing a broken Excel file. (:issue:`9794`)

- ``DataFrame`` and ``Series`` now have ``_constructor_expanddim`` property as overridable constructor for one higher dimensionality data. This should be used only when it is really needed, see :ref:`here <ref-subclassing-pandas>`

.. _whatsnew_0161.enhancements.categoricalindex:

CategoricalIndex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We introduce a ``CategoricalIndex``, a new type of index object that is useful for supporting
indexing with duplicates. This is a container around a ``Categorical`` (introduced in v0.15.0)
and allows efficient indexing and storage of an index with a large number of duplicated elements. Prior to 0.16.1,
setting the index of a ``DataFrame/Series`` with a ``category`` dtype would convert this to regular object-based ``Index``.

.. ipython :: python

   df = DataFrame({'A' : np.arange(6),
                   'B' : Series(list('aabbca')).astype('category',
                                                       categories=list('cab'))
                  })
   df
   df.dtypes
   df.B.cat.categories

setting the index, will create create a CategoricalIndex

.. ipython :: python

   df2 = df.set_index('B')
   df2.index

indexing with ``__getitem__/.iloc/.loc/.ix`` works similarly to an Index with duplicates.
The indexers MUST be in the category or the operation will raise.

.. ipython :: python

   df2.loc['a']

and preserves the ``CategoricalIndex``

.. ipython :: python

   df2.loc['a'].index

sorting will order by the order of the categories

.. ipython :: python

   df2.sort_index()

groupby operations on the index will preserve the index nature as well

.. ipython :: python

   df2.groupby(level=0).sum()
   df2.groupby(level=0).sum().index

reindexing operations, will return a resulting index based on the type of the passed
indexer, meaning that passing a list will return a plain-old-``Index``; indexing with
a ``Categorical`` will return a ``CategoricalIndex``, indexed according to the categories
of the PASSED ``Categorical`` dtype. This allows one to arbitrarly index these even with
values NOT in the categories, similarly to how you can reindex ANY pandas index.

.. ipython :: python

   df2.reindex(['a','e'])
   df2.reindex(['a','e']).index
   df2.reindex(pd.Categorical(['a','e'],categories=list('abcde')))
   df2.reindex(pd.Categorical(['a','e'],categories=list('abcde'))).index

See the :ref:`documentation <advanced.categoricalindex>` for more. (:issue:`7629`)

.. _whatsnew_0161.api:

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~





- When passing in an ax to ``df.plot( ..., ax=ax)``, the `sharex` kwarg will now default to `False`.
  The result is that the visibility of xlabels and xticklabels will not anymore be changed. You
  have to do that by yourself for the right axes in your figure or set ``sharex=True`` explicitly
  (but this changes the visible for all axes in the figure, not only the one which is passed in!).
  If pandas creates the subplots itself (e.g. no passed in `ax` kwarg), then the
  default is still ``sharex=True`` and the visibility changes are applied.



- Add support for separating years and quarters using dashes, for
  example 2014-Q1.  (:issue:`9688`)

- :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.assign` now inserts new columns in alphabetical order. Previously
  the order was arbitrary. (:issue:`9777`)

- By default, ``read_csv`` and ``read_table`` will now try to infer the compression type based on the file extension. Set ``compression=None`` to restore the previous behavior (no decompression). (:issue:`9770`)

.. _whatsnew_0161.performance:

Performance Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved csv write performance with mixed dtypes, including datetimes by up to 5x (:issue:`9940`)
- Improved csv write performance generally by 2x (:issue:`9940`)
