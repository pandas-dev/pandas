v0.15.2 (December 12, 2014)
---------------------------

This is a minor release from 0.15.1 and includes a large number of bug fixes
along with several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements.
A small number of API changes were necessary to fix existing bugs.
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Indexing in ``MultiIndex`` beyond lex-sort depth is now supported, though
  a lexically sorted index will have a better performance. (:issue:`2646`)

  .. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    df = pd.DataFrame({'jim':[0, 0, 1, 1],
                       'joe':['x', 'x', 'z', 'y'],
                       'jolie':np.random.rand(4)}).set_index(['jim', 'joe'])
    df
    df.index.lexsort_depth

    # in prior versions this would raise a KeyError
    # will now show a PerformanceWarning
    df.loc[(1, 'z')]

    # lexically sorting
    df2 = df.sortlevel()
    df2
    df2.index.lexsort_depth
    df2.loc[(1,'z')]

- Bug in unique of Series with ``category`` dtype, which returned all categories regardless
  whether they were "used" or not (see :issue:`8559` for the discussion).
  Previous behaviour was to return all categories:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: cat = pd.Categorical(['a', 'b', 'a'], categories=['a', 'b', 'c'])

    In [4]: cat
    Out[4]:
    [a, b, a]
    Categories (3, object): [a < b < c]

    In [5]: cat.unique()
    Out[5]: array(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype=object)

  Now, only the categories that do effectively occur in the array are returned:

  .. ipython:: python

    cat = pd.Categorical(['a', 'b', 'a'], categories=['a', 'b', 'c'])
    cat.unique()

- ``Series.all`` and ``Series.any`` now support the ``level`` and ``skipna`` parameters. ``Series.all``, ``Series.any``, ``Index.all``, and ``Index.any`` no longer support the ``out`` and ``keepdims`` parameters, which existed for compatibility with ndarray. Various index types no longer support the ``all`` and ``any`` aggregation functions and will now raise ``TypeError``. (:issue:`8302`).

- Allow equality comparisons of Series with a categorical dtype and object dtype; previously these would raise ``TypeError`` (:issue:`8938`)

- Bug in ``NDFrame``: conflicting attribute/column names now behave consistently between getting and setting. Previously, when both a column and attribute named ``y`` existed, ``data.y`` would return the attribute, while ``data.y = z`` would update the column (:issue:`8994`)

  .. ipython:: python

     data = pd.DataFrame({'x':[1, 2, 3]})
     data.y = 2
     data['y'] = [2, 4, 6]
     data

     # this assignment was inconsistent
     data.y = 5

  Old behavior:

  .. code-block:: ipython

     In [6]: data.y
     Out[6]: 2

     In [7]: data['y'].values
     Out[7]: array([5, 5, 5])

  New behavior:

  .. ipython:: python

     data.y
     data['y'].values

- ``Timestamp('now')`` is now equivalent to ``Timestamp.now()`` in that it returns the local time rather than UTC. Also, ``Timestamp('today')`` is now equivalent to ``Timestamp.today()`` and both have ``tz`` as a possible argument. (:issue:`9000`)

- Fix negative step support for label-based slices (:issue:`8753`)

  Old behavior:

  .. code-block:: ipython

     In [1]: s = pd.Series(np.arange(3), ['a', 'b', 'c'])
     Out[1]:
     a    0
     b    1
     c    2
     dtype: int64

     In [2]: s.loc['c':'a':-1]
     Out[2]:
     c    2
     dtype: int64

  New behavior:

  .. ipython:: python

     s = pd.Series(np.arange(3), ['a', 'b', 'c'])
     s.loc['c':'a':-1]


.. _whatsnew_0152.enhancements:

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Categorical`` enhancements:

- Added ability to export Categorical data to Stata (:issue:`8633`).  See :ref:`here <io.stata-categorical>` for limitations of categorical variables exported to Stata data files.
- Added flag ``order_categoricals`` to ``StataReader`` and ``read_stata`` to select whether to order imported categorical data (:issue:`8836`).  See :ref:`here <io.stata-categorical>` for more information on importing categorical variables from Stata data files.
- Added ability to export Categorical data to to/from HDF5 (:issue:`7621`). Queries work the same as if it was an object array. However, the ``category`` dtyped data is stored in a more efficient manner. See :ref:`here <io.hdf5-categorical>` for an example and caveats w.r.t. prior versions of pandas.
- Added support for ``searchsorted()`` on `Categorical` class (:issue:`8420`).

Other enhancements:

- Added the ability to specify the SQL type of columns when writing a DataFrame
  to a database (:issue:`8778`).
  For example, specifying to use the sqlalchemy ``String`` type instead of the
  default ``Text`` type for string columns:

  .. code-block:: python

     from sqlalchemy.types import String
     data.to_sql('data_dtype', engine, dtype={'Col_1': String})

- ``Series.all`` and ``Series.any`` now support the ``level`` and ``skipna`` parameters (:issue:`8302`):

  .. ipython:: python

     s = pd.Series([False, True, False], index=[0, 0, 1])
     s.any(level=0)

- ``Panel`` now supports the ``all`` and ``any`` aggregation functions. (:issue:`8302`):

  .. ipython:: python

     p = pd.Panel(np.random.rand(2, 5, 4) > 0.1)
     p.all()

- Added support for ``utcfromtimestamp()``, ``fromtimestamp()``, and ``combine()`` on `Timestamp` class (:issue:`5351`).
- Added Google Analytics (`pandas.io.ga`) basic documentation (:issue:`8835`). See :ref:`here<remote_data.ga>`.
- ``Timedelta`` arithmetic returns ``NotImplemented`` in unknown cases, allowing extensions by custom classes (:issue:`8813`).
- ``Timedelta`` now supports arithemtic with ``numpy.ndarray`` objects of the appropriate dtype (numpy 1.8 or newer only) (:issue:`8884`).
- Added ``Timedelta.to_timedelta64()`` method to the public API (:issue:`8884`).
- Added ``gbq.generate_bq_schema()`` function to the gbq module (:issue:`8325`).
- ``Series`` now works with map objects the same way as generators (:issue:`8909`).
- Added context manager to ``HDFStore`` for automatic closing (:issue:`8791`).
- ``to_datetime`` gains an ``exact`` keyword to allow for a format to not require an exact match for a provided format string (if its ``False``). ``exact`` defaults to ``True`` (meaning that exact matching is still the default)  (:issue:`8904`)
- Added ``axvlines`` boolean option to parallel_coordinates plot function, determines whether vertical lines will be printed, default is True
- Added ability to read table footers to read_html (:issue:`8552`)
- ``to_sql`` now infers datatypes of non-NA values for columns that contain NA values and have dtype ``object`` (:issue:`8778`).


.. _whatsnew_0152.performance:
