.. _whatsnew_0141:

v0.14.1 (July 11, 2014)
-----------------------

This is a minor release from 0.14.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version.

- Highlights include:

  - New methods :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.select_dtypes` to select columns
    based on the dtype and :meth:`~pandas.Series.sem` to calculate the
    standard error of the mean.
  - Support for dateutil timezones (see :ref:`docs <timeseries.timezone>`).
  - Support for ignoring full line comments in the :func:`~pandas.read_csv`
    text parser.
  - New documentation section on :ref:`Options and Settings <options>`.
  - Lots of bug fixes.

.. _whatsnew_0141.api:

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Openpyxl now raises a ValueError on construction of the openpyxl writer
  instead of warning on pandas import (:issue:`7284`).

- For ``StringMethods.extract``, when no match is found, the result - only
  containing ``NaN`` values - now also has ``dtype=object`` instead of
  ``float`` (:issue:`7242`)

- ``Period`` objects no longer raise a ``TypeError`` when compared using ``==``
  with another object that *isn't* a ``Period``. Instead
  when comparing a ``Period`` with another object using ``==`` if the other
  object isn't a ``Period`` ``False`` is returned. (:issue:`7376`)

- Previously, the behaviour on resetting the time or not in
  ``offsets.apply``, ``rollforward`` and ``rollback`` operations differed
  between offsets. With the support of the ``normalize`` keyword for all offsets(see
  below) with a default value of False (preserve time), the behaviour changed for certain
  offsets (BusinessMonthBegin, MonthEnd, BusinessMonthEnd, CustomBusinessMonthEnd,
  BusinessYearBegin, LastWeekOfMonth, FY5253Quarter, LastWeekOfMonth, Easter):

  .. code-block:: ipython

     In [6]: from pandas.tseries import offsets

     In [7]: d = pd.Timestamp('2014-01-01 09:00')

     # old behaviour < 0.14.1
     In [8]: d + offsets.MonthEnd()
     Out[8]: Timestamp('2014-01-31 00:00:00')

  Starting from 0.14.1 all offsets preserve time by default. The old
  behaviour can be obtained with ``normalize=True``

  .. ipython:: python
     :suppress:

     import pandas.tseries.offsets as offsets
     d = pd.Timestamp('2014-01-01 09:00')

  .. ipython:: python

     # new behaviour
     d + offsets.MonthEnd()
     d + offsets.MonthEnd(normalize=True)

  Note that for the other offsets the default behaviour did not change.

- Add back ``#N/A N/A`` as a default NA value in text parsing, (regression from 0.12) (:issue:`5521`)
- Raise a ``TypeError`` on inplace-setting with a ``.where`` and a non ``np.nan`` value as this is inconsistent
  with a set-item expression like ``df[mask] = None`` (:issue:`7656`)


.. _whatsnew_0141.enhancements:

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``dropna`` argument to ``value_counts`` and ``nunique`` (:issue:`5569`).
- Add :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.select_dtypes` method to allow selection of
  columns based on dtype (:issue:`7316`). See :ref:`the docs <basics.selectdtypes>`.
- All ``offsets`` supports the ``normalize`` keyword to specify whether
  ``offsets.apply``, ``rollforward`` and ``rollback`` resets the time (hour,
  minute, etc) or not (default ``False``, preserves time) (:issue:`7156`):

  .. code-block:: python

     import pandas.tseries.offsets as offsets

     day = offsets.Day()
     day.apply(Timestamp('2014-01-01 09:00'))

     day = offsets.Day(normalize=True)
     day.apply(Timestamp('2014-01-01 09:00'))

- ``PeriodIndex`` is represented as the same format as ``DatetimeIndex`` (:issue:`7601`)
- ``StringMethods`` now work on empty Series (:issue:`7242`)
- The file parsers ``read_csv`` and ``read_table`` now ignore line comments provided by
  the parameter `comment`, which accepts only a single character for the C reader.
  In particular, they allow for comments before file data begins (:issue:`2685`)
- Add ``NotImplementedError`` for simultaneous use of ``chunksize`` and ``nrows``
  for read_csv() (:issue:`6774`).
- Tests for basic reading of public S3 buckets now exist (:issue:`7281`).
- ``read_html`` now sports an ``encoding`` argument that is passed to the
  underlying parser library. You can use this to read non-ascii encoded web
  pages (:issue:`7323`).
- ``read_excel`` now supports reading from URLs in the same way
  that ``read_csv`` does.  (:issue:`6809`)
- Support for dateutil timezones, which can now be used in the same way as
  pytz timezones across pandas. (:issue:`4688`)

  .. ipython:: python

     rng = date_range('3/6/2012 00:00', periods=10, freq='D',
                      tz='dateutil/Europe/London')
     rng.tz

  See :ref:`the docs <timeseries.timezone>`.

- Implemented ``sem`` (standard error of the mean) operation for ``Series``,
  ``DataFrame``, ``Panel``, and ``Groupby`` (:issue:`6897`)
- Add ``nlargest`` and ``nsmallest`` to the ``Series`` ``groupby`` whitelist,
  which means you can now use these methods on a ``SeriesGroupBy`` object
  (:issue:`7053`).
- All offsets ``apply``, ``rollforward`` and ``rollback`` can now handle ``np.datetime64``, previously results in ``ApplyTypeError`` (:issue:`7452`)
- ``Period`` and ``PeriodIndex`` can contain ``NaT`` in its values (:issue:`7485`)
- Support pickling ``Series``, ``DataFrame`` and ``Panel`` objects with
  non-unique labels along *item* axis (``index``, ``columns`` and ``items``
  respectively) (:issue:`7370`).
- Improved inference of datetime/timedelta with mixed null objects. Regression from 0.13.1 in interpretation of an object Index
  with all null elements (:issue:`7431`)

.. _whatsnew_0141.performance:

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Improvements in dtype inference for numeric operations involving yielding performance gains for dtypes: ``int64``, ``timedelta64``, ``datetime64`` (:issue:`7223`)
- Improvements in Series.transform for significant performance gains (:issue:`6496`)
- Improvements in DataFrame.transform with ufuncs and built-in grouper functions for significant performance gains (:issue:`7383`)
- Regression in groupby aggregation of datetime64 dtypes (:issue:`7555`)
- Improvements in `MultiIndex.from_product` for large iterables (:issue:`7627`)


.. _whatsnew_0141.experimental:

Experimental
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``pandas.io.data.Options`` has a new method, ``get_all_data`` method, and now consistently returns a
  MultiIndexed ``DataFrame`` (:issue:`5602`)
- ``io.gbq.read_gbq`` and ``io.gbq.to_gbq`` were refactored to remove the
  dependency on the Google ``bq.py`` command line client. This submodule
  now uses ``httplib2`` and the Google ``apiclient`` and ``oauth2client`` API client
  libraries which should be more stable and, therefore, reliable than
  ``bq.py``. See :ref:`the docs <io.bigquery>`. (:issue:`6937`).
