For example, ``df.mean()`` calculates the mean of a DataFrame. Parentheses are also used to group expressions, such as ``(a + b) * c``, or to create tuples: ``(1, 2, 3)``.\n- **Square brackets** are used for indexing, selecting data, and defining lists. In pandas, you use square brackets to select columns or filter dataâ€”for instance, ``df['A']`` selects column ``A``, while ``df[0:3]`` selects rows by position. In standard Python, square brackets are also used to define a list, as in ``my_list = [1, 2, 3]``.\n\n\n**Remember :**\nUse ``[]`` for selection or indexing, and ``()`` for calling functions or grouping expressions.\n\nFor more explanation, see `Brackets in Python and pandas <https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/brackets.html>`__.\n
