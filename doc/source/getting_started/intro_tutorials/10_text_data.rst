How to manipulate textual data
------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <ul class="task-bullet">
        <li>

Make all name characters lowercase.

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Name"].str.lower()

To make each of the strings in the ``Name`` column lowercase, select the ``Name`` column
(see the :ref:`tutorial on selection of data <10min_tut_03_subset>`), add the ``str`` accessor and
apply the ``lower`` method. As such, each of the strings is converted element-wise.

.. raw:: html

        </li>
    </ul>

Similar to datetime objects in the :ref:`time series tutorial <10min_tut_09_timeseries>`
having a ``dt`` accessor, a number of
specialized string methods are available when using the ``str``
accessor. These methods have in general matching names with the
equivalent built-in string methods for single elements, but are applied
element-wise (remember :ref:`element-wise calculations <10min_tut_05_columns>`?)
on each of the values of the columns.

.. raw:: html

    <ul class="task-bullet">
        <li>

Create a new column ``Surname`` that contains the surname of the passengers by extracting the part before the comma.

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Name"].str.split(",")

Using the :meth:`Series.str.split` method, each of the values is returned as a list of
2 elements. The first element is the part before the comma and the
second element is the part after the comma.

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Surname"] = titanic["Name"].str.split(",").str.get(0)
    titanic["Surname"]

As we are only interested in the first part representing the surname
(element 0), we can again use the ``str`` accessor and apply :meth:`Series.str.get` to
extract the relevant part. Indeed, these string functions can be
concatenated to combine multiple functions at once!

Extract the passenger data about the countesses on board of the Titanic.

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Name"].str.contains("Countess")

.. ipython:: python

    titanic[titanic["Name"].str.contains("Countess")]

(*Interested in her story? See* `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Leslie,_Countess_of_Rothes>`__\ *!*)

The string method :meth:`Series.str.contains` checks for each of the values in the
column ``Name`` if the string contains the word ``Countess`` and returns
for each of the values ``True`` (``Countess`` is part of the name) or
``False`` (``Countess`` is not part of the name). This output can be used
to subselect the data using conditional (boolean) indexing introduced in
the :ref:`subsetting of data tutorial <10min_tut_03_subset>`. As there was
only one countess on the Titanic, we get one row as a result.

.. raw:: html

        </li>
    </ul>

.. note::
    More powerful extractions on strings are supported, as the
    :meth:`Series.str.contains` and :meth:`Series.str.extract` methods accept `regular
    expressions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__, but are out of
    the scope of this tutorial.

Which passenger of the Titanic has the longest name?

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Name"].str.len()

To get the longest name we first have to get the lengths of each of the
names in the ``Name`` column. By using pandas string methods, the
:meth:`Series.str.len` function is applied to each of the names individually
(element-wise).

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Name"].str.len().idxmax()

Next, we need to get the corresponding location, preferably the index
label, in the table for which the name length is the largest. The
:meth:`~Series.idxmax` method does exactly that. It is not a string method and is
applied to integers, so no ``str`` is used.

.. ipython:: python

    titanic.loc[titanic["Name"].str.len().idxmax(), "Name"]

Based on the index name of the row (``307``) and the column (``Name``),
we can do a selection using the ``loc`` operator, introduced in the
:ref:`tutorial on subsetting <10min_tut_03_subset>`.

.. raw:: html

        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="task-bullet">

In the "Sex" column, replace values of "male" by "M" and values of "female" by "F".

.. ipython:: python

    titanic["Sex_short"] = titanic["Sex"].replace({"male": "M", "female": "F"})
    titanic["Sex_short"]

Whereas :meth:`~Series.replace` is not a string method, it provides a convenient way
to use mappings or vocabularies to translate certain values. It requires
a ``dictionary`` to define the mapping ``{from: to}``.

.. raw:: html

        </li>
    </ul>

.. warning::
    There is also a :meth:`~Series.str.replace` method available to replace a
    specific set of characters. However, when having a mapping of multiple
    values, this would become:

    ::

        titanic["Sex_short"] = titanic["Sex"].str.replace("female", "F")
        titanic["Sex_short"] = titanic["Sex_short"].str.replace("male", "M")

    This would become cumbersome and easily lead to mistakes. Just think (or
    try out yourself) what would happen if those two statements are applied
    in the opposite orderâ€¦

-  String methods are available using the ``str`` accessor.
-  String methods work element-wise and can be used for conditional
   indexing.
-  The ``replace`` method is a convenient method to convert values
   according to a given dictionary.
