    with which to guide our search for inputs that will cause an error, in
    addition to all the usual heuristics.  Observations must always be finite.

    Hypothesis will try to maximize the observed value over several examples;
    almost any metric will work so long as it makes sense to increase it.
    For example, ``-abs(error)`` is a metric that increases as ``error``
    approaches zero.

    Example metrics:

    - Number of elements in a collection, or tasks in a queue
    - Mean or maximum runtime of a task (or both, if you use ``label``)
    - Compression ratio for data (perhaps per-algorithm or per-level)
    - Number of steps taken by a state machine

    The optional ``label`` argument can be used to distinguish between
    and therefore separately optimise distinct observations, such as the
    mean and standard deviation of a dataset.  It is an error to call
    ``target()`` with any label more than once per test case.

    .. note::
        The more examples you run, the better this technique works.

        As a rule of thumb, the targeting effect is noticeable above
        :obj:`max_examples=1000 <hypothesis.settings.max_examples>`,
        and immediately obvious by around ten thousand examples
        *per label* used by your test.

    :ref:`statistics` include the best score seen for each label,
    which can help avoid `the threshold problem
    <https://hypothesis.works/articles/threshold-problem/>`__ when the minimal
    example shrinks right down to the threshold of failure (:issue:`2180`).
