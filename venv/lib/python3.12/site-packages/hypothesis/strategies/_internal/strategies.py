    """Handle properties which may be mutually recursive among a set of
    strategies.

    These are essentially lazily cached properties, with the ability to set
    an override: If the property has not been explicitly set, we calculate
    it on first access and memoize the result for later.

    The problem is that for properties that depend on each other, a naive
    calculation strategy may hit infinite recursion. Consider for example
    the property is_empty. A strategy defined as x = st.deferred(lambda: x)
    is certainly empty (in order to draw a value from x we would have to
    draw a value from x, for which we would have to draw a value from x,
    ...), but in order to calculate it the naive approach would end up
    calling x.is_empty in order to calculate x.is_empty in order to etc.

    The solution is one of fixed point calculation. We start with a default
    value that is the value of the property in the absence of evidence to
    the contrary, and then update the values of the property for all
    dependent strategies until we reach a fixed point.

    The approach taken roughly follows that in section 4.2 of Adams,
    Michael D., Celeste Hollenbeck, and Matthew Might. "On the complexity
    and performance of parsing with derivatives." ACM SIGPLAN Notices 51.6
    (2016): 224-236.
