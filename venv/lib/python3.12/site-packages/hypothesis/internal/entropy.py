def register_random(r: RandomLike) -> None:
    """Register (a weakref to) the given Random-like instance for management by
    Hypothesis.

    You can pass instances of structural subtypes of ``random.Random``
    (i.e., objects with seed, getstate, and setstate methods) to
    ``register_random(r)`` to have their states seeded and restored in the same
    way as the global PRNGs from the ``random`` and ``numpy.random`` modules.

    All global PRNGs, from e.g. simulation or scheduling frameworks, should
    be registered to prevent flaky tests. Hypothesis will ensure that the
    PRNG state is consistent for all test runs, always seeding them to zero and
    restoring the previous state after the test, or, reproducibly varied if you
    choose to use the :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.random_module` strategy.

    ``register_random`` only makes `weakrefs
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#module-weakref>`_ to ``r``,
    thus ``r`` will only be managed by Hypothesis as long as it has active
    references elsewhere at runtime. The pattern ``register_random(MyRandom())``
    will raise a ``ReferenceError`` to help protect users from this issue.
    This check does not occur for the PyPy interpreter. See the following example for
    an illustration of this issue
