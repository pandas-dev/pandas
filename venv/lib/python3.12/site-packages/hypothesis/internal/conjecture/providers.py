#: to be used in |settings.backend|, and whose values are a string of the absolute
#: importable path to a subclass of |PrimitiveProvider|, which Hypothesis will
#: instantiate when your backend is requested by a test's |settings.backend| value.
#:
#: For example, the default Hypothesis backend is registered as:
#:
#: .. code-block:: python
#:
#:    from hypothesis.internal.conjecture.providers import AVAILABLE_PROVIDERS
#:
#:    AVAILABLE_PROVIDERS["hypothesis"] = "hypothesis.internal.conjecture.providers.HypothesisProvider"

#: typically not have any effect.
#:
#: The purpose of mapping to an absolute importable path, rather than the actual
#: |PrimitiveProvider| class, is to avoid slowing down Hypothesis startup times

    |PrimitiveProvider| is the implementation interface of a

    A |PrimitiveProvider| is required to implement the following five

    * |PrimitiveProvider.draw_boolean|
    * |PrimitiveProvider.draw_float|
    * |PrimitiveProvider.draw_string|
    * |PrimitiveProvider.draw_bytes|

    Each strategy in Hypothesis generates values by drawing a series of choices
    from these five methods. By overriding them, a |PrimitiveProvider| can control
    the distribution of inputs generated by Hypothesis.

    For example, :pypi:`hypothesis-crosshair` implements a |PrimitiveProvider|
    which uses an SMT solver to generate inputs that uncover new branches.

    Once you implement a |PrimitiveProvider|, you can make it available for use
    through |AVAILABLE_PROVIDERS|.

            For |PrimitiveProvider.on_observation| to be called by Hypothesis,
            |PrimitiveProvider.add_observability_callback| must be set to ``True``.

            |PrimitiveProvider.on_observation| is explicitly opt-in, as enabling
            observability might increase runtime or memory usage.

        Calls to this method are guaranteed to alternate with calls to
        |PrimitiveProvider.per_test_case_context_manager|. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # test function starts
            per_test_case_context_manager()
            on_observation()
            per_test_case_context_manager()
            on_observation()
            ...
            # test function ends

        Note that |PrimitiveProvider.on_observation| will not be called for test
        cases which did not use this provider during generation, for example
        during |Phase.reuse| or |Phase.shrink|, or because Hypothesis switched
        to the standard Hypothesis backend after this backend raised too many
        |BackendCannotProceed| exceptions.

    def span_start(self, label: int, /) -> None:  # noqa: B027  # non-abstract noop
        """Marks the beginning of a semantically meaningful span of choices.

        Spans are a depth-first tree structure. A span is opened by a call to
        |PrimitiveProvider.span_start|, and a call to |PrimitiveProvider.span_end|
        closes the most recently opened span. So the following sequence of calls:

        .. code-block:: python

            span_start(label=1)
            n1 = draw_integer()
            span_start(label=2)
            b1 = draw_boolean()
            n2 = draw_integer()
            span_end()
            f1 = draw_float()
            span_end()

        produces the following two spans of choices:

        .. code-block::

            1: [n1, b1, n2, f1]
            2: [b1, n2]

        Hypothesis uses spans to denote "semantically meaningful" sequences of
        choices. For instance, Hypothesis opens a span for the sequence of choices
        made while drawing from each strategy. Not every span corresponds to a
        strategy; the generation of e.g. each element in |st.lists| is also marked
        with a span, among others.

        ``label`` is an opaque integer, which has no defined semantics.
        The only guarantee made by Hypothesis is that all spans with the same
        "meaning" will share the same ``label``. So all spans from the same
        strategy will share the same label, as will e.g. the spans for |st.lists|
        elements.

        Providers can track calls to |PrimitiveProvider.span_start| and
        |PrimitiveProvider.span_end| to learn something about the semantics of
        the test's choice sequence. For instance, a provider could track the depth
        of the span tree, or the number of unique labels, which says something about
        the complexity of the choices being generated. Or a provider could track
        the span tree across test cases in order to determine what strategies are
        being used in what contexts.

        It is possible for Hypothesis to start and immediately stop a span,
        without calling a ``draw_*`` method in between. These spans contain zero
        choices.

        Hypothesis will always balance the number of calls to
        |PrimitiveProvider.span_start| and |PrimitiveProvider.span_end|. A call
        to |PrimitiveProvider.span_start| will always be followed by a call to
        |PrimitiveProvider.span_end| before the end of the test case.

        |PrimitiveProvider.span_start| is called from ``ConjectureData.start_span()``
        internally.

        ``discard`` is ``True`` when the draw was filtered out or otherwise marked
