# The number of max children where, beyond this, it is practically impossible
# for hypothesis to saturate / explore all children nodes in a reasonable time
# frame. We use this to bail out of expensive max children computations early,
# where the numbers involved are so large that we know they will be larger than
# this number.
#
# Note that it's ok for us to underestimate the number of max children of a node
# by using this. We just may think the node is exhausted when in fact it has more
# possible children to be explored. This has the potential to finish generation
# early due to exhausting the entire tree, but that is quite unlikely: (1) the
# number of examples would have to be quite high, and (2) the tree would have to
# contain only one or two nodes, or generate_novel_prefix would simply switch to
# exploring another non-exhausted node.
#
# Also note that we may sometimes compute max children above this value. In other
# words, this is *not* a hard maximum on the computed max children. It's the point
# where further computation is not beneficial - but sometimes doing that computation
# unconditionally is cheaper than estimating against this value.
#
# The one case where this may be detrimental is fuzzing, where the throughput of
# examples is so high that it really may saturate important nodes. We'll cross
# that bridge when we come to it.

class TreeNode:
    """
    A node, or collection of directly descended nodes, in a DataTree.

    We store the DataTree as a radix tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree),
    which means that nodes that are the only child of their parent are collapsed
    into their parent to save space.

    Conceptually, you can unfold a single TreeNode storing n values in its lists
    into a sequence of n nodes, each a child of the last. In other words,
    (constraints[i], values[i], choice_types[i]) corresponds to the single node at index
    i.

    Note that if a TreeNode represents a choice (i.e. the nodes cannot be compacted
    via the radix tree definition), then its lists will be empty and it will
    store a `Branch` representing that choce in its `transition`.

    Examples
    --------

    Consider sequentially drawing a boolean, then an integer.

            data.draw_boolean()
            data.draw_integer(1, 3)

    If we draw True and then 2, the tree may conceptually look like this.

                      ┌──────┐
                      │ root │
                      └──┬───┘
                      ┌──┴───┐
                      │ True │
                      └──┬───┘
                      ┌──┴───┐
                      │  2   │
                      └──────┘

    But since 2 is the only child of True, we will compact these nodes and store
    them as a single TreeNode.

                      ┌──────┐
                      │ root │
                      └──┬───┘
                    ┌────┴──────┐
                    │ [True, 2] │
                    └───────────┘

    If we then draw True and then 3, True will have multiple children and we
    can no longer store this compacted representation. We would call split_at(0)
    on the [True, 2] node to indicate that we need to add a choice at 0-index
    node (True).

                      ┌──────┐
                      │ root │
                      └──┬───┘

class DataTree:
    """
    A DataTree tracks the structured history of draws in some test function,
    across multiple ConjectureData objects.

    This information is used by ConjectureRunner to generate novel prefixes of
    this tree (see generate_novel_prefix). A novel prefix is a sequence of draws
    which the tree has not seen before, and therefore the ConjectureRunner has
    not generated as an input to the test function before.

    DataTree tracks the following:

    - Drawn choices in the choice sequence
      - ConjectureData.draw_integer()
      - ConjectureData.draw_float()
      - ConjectureData.draw_string()
      - ConjectureData.draw_boolean()
      - ConjectureData.draw_bytes()
    - Test conclusions (with some Status, e.g. Status.VALID)
      - ConjectureData.conclude_test()

    A DataTree is — surprise — a *tree*. A node in this tree is either a choice draw
    with some value, a test conclusion with some Status, or a special `Killed` value,
    which denotes that further draws may exist beyond this node but should not be
    considered worth exploring when generating novel prefixes. A node is a leaf
    iff it is a conclusion or Killed.

    A branch from node A to node B indicates that we have previously seen some
    sequence (a, b) of draws, where a and b are the values in nodes A and B.
    Similar intuition holds for conclusion and Killed nodes.

    Examples
    --------

    To see how a DataTree gets built through successive sets of draws, consider
    the following code that calls through to some ConjecutreData object `data`.
    The first call can be either True or False, and the second call can be any
    integer in the range [1, 3].

        data.draw_boolean()
        data.draw_integer(1, 3)

    To start, the corresponding DataTree object is completely empty.

                      ┌──────┐
                      │ root │
                      └──────┘

    We happen to draw True and then 2 in the above code. The tree tracks this.
    (2 also connects to a child Conclusion node with Status.VALID since it's the
    final draw in the code. I'll omit Conclusion nodes in diagrams for brevity.)

                      ┌──────┐
                      │ root │
                      └──┬───┘
                      ┌──┴───┐
                      │ True │
                      └──┬───┘
                      ┌──┴───┐
                      │  2   │
                      └──────┘

    This is a very boring tree so far! But now we happen to draw False and
    then 1. This causes a split in the tree. Remember, DataTree tracks history
    over all invocations of a function, not just one. The end goal is to know
    what invocations haven't been tried yet, after all.

                      ┌──────┐
                  ┌───┤ root ├───┐
                  │   └──────┘   │
               ┌──┴───┐        ┌─┴─────┐
               │ True │        │ False │
               └──┬───┘        └──┬────┘
                ┌─┴─┐           ┌─┴─┐
                │ 2 │           │ 1 │
                └───┘           └───┘

    If we were to ask DataTree for a novel prefix at this point, it might
    generate any of (True, 1), (True, 3), (False, 2), or (False, 3).

    Note that the novel prefix stops as soon as it generates a novel node. For
    instance, if we had generated a novel prefix back when the tree was only
    root -> True -> 2, we could have gotten any of (True, 1), (True, 3), or
    (False). But we could *not* have gotten (False, n), because both False and
    n were novel at that point, and we stop at the first novel node — False.

    I won't belabor this example. Here's what the tree looks like when fully
    explored:

                      ┌──────┐
               ┌──────┤ root ├──────┐
               │      └──────┘      │
            ┌──┴───┐              ┌─┴─────┐
         ┌──┤ True ├──┐       ┌───┤ False ├──┐
         │  └──┬───┘  │       │   └──┬────┘  │
       ┌─┴─┐ ┌─┴─┐  ┌─┴─┐   ┌─┴─┐  ┌─┴─┐   ┌─┴─┐
       │ 1 │ │ 2 │  │ 3 │   │ 1 │  │ 2 │   │ 3 │
       └───┘ └───┘  └───┘   └───┘  └───┘   └───┘

    You could imagine much more complicated trees than this arising in practice,
    and indeed they do. In particular, the tree need not be balanced or 'nice'
    like the tree above. For instance,

        b = data.draw_boolean()
        if b:
            data.draw_integer(1, 3)

    results in a tree with the entire right part lopped off, and False leading
    straight to a conclusion node with Status.VALID. As another example,

        n = data.draw_integers()
        assume(n >= 3)
        data.draw_string()

    results in a tree with the 0, 1, and 2 nodes leading straight to a
    conclusion node with Status.INVALID, and the rest branching off into all
    the possibilities of draw_string.

    Notes
    -----

    The above examples are slightly simplified and are intended to convey
    intuition. In practice, there are some implementation details to be aware
    of.

    - In draw nodes, we store the constraints used in addition to the value drawn.
      E.g. the node corresponding to data.draw_float(min_value=1.0, max_value=1.5)
      would store {"min_value": 1.0, "max_value": 1.5, ...} (default values for
      other constraints omitted).

      The constraints parameters have the potential to change both the range of
      possible outputs of a node, and the probability distribution within that
      range, so we need to use these when drawing in DataTree as well. We draw
      values using these constraints when (1) generating a novel value for a node
      and (2) choosing a random child when traversing the tree.

    - For space efficiency, rather than tracking the full tree structure, we
      store DataTree as a radix tree. This is conceptually equivalent (radix
      trees can always be "unfolded" to the full tree) but it means the internal
      representation may differ in practice.
