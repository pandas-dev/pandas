class ParetoFront:
    """Maintains an approximate pareto front of ConjectureData objects. That
    is, we try to maintain a collection of objects such that no element of the
    collection is pareto dominated by any other. In practice we don't quite
    manage that, because doing so is computationally very expensive. Instead
    we maintain a random sample of data objects that are "rarely" dominated by
    any other element of the collection (roughly, no more than about 10%).

    Only valid test cases are considered to belong to the pareto front - any
    test case with a status less than valid is discarded.

    Note that the pareto front is potentially quite large, and currently this
    will store the entire front in memory. This is bounded by the number of
    valid examples we run, which is max_examples in normal execution, and
    currently we do not support workflows with large max_examples which have
    large values of max_examples very well anyway, so this isn't a major issue.
    In future we may weish to implement some sort of paging out to disk so that
    we can work with larger fronts.

    Additionally, because this is only an approximate pareto front, there are
    scenarios where it can be much larger than the actual pareto front. There
    isn't a huge amount we can do about this - checking an exact pareto front
    is intrinsically quadratic.

    "Most" of the time we should be relatively close to the true pareto front,
    say within an order of magnitude, but it's not hard to construct scenarios
    where this is not the case. e.g. suppose we enumerate all valid test cases
    in increasing shortlex order as s_1, ..., s_n, ... and have scores f and
    g such that f(s_i) = min(i, N) and g(s_i) = 1 if i >= N, then the pareto
    front is the set {s_1, ..., S_N}, but the only element of the front that
    will dominate s_i when i > N is S_N, which we select with probability
    1 / N. A better data structure could solve this, but at the cost of more
    expensive operations and higher per element memory use, so we'll wait to
    see how much of a problem this is in practice before we try that.
