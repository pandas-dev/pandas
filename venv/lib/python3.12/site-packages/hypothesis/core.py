    """
    Add an explicit input to a Hypothesis test, which Hypothesis will always
    try before generating random inputs. This combines the randomized nature of
    Hypothesis generation with a traditional parametrized test.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        @example("Hello world")
        @example("some string with special significance")
        @given(st.text())
        def test_strings(s):
            pass

    will call ``test_strings("Hello World")`` and
    ``test_strings("some string with special significance")`` before generating
    any random inputs. |@example| may be placed in any order relative to |@given|
    and |@settings|.

    Explicit inputs from |@example| are run in the |Phase.explicit| phase.
    Explicit inputs do not count towards |settings.max_examples|. Note that
    explicit inputs added by |@example| do not shrink. If an explicit input
    fails, Hypothesis will stop and report the failure without generating any
    random inputs.

    |@example| can also be used to easily reproduce a failure. For instance, if
    Hypothesis reports that ``f(n=[0, math.nan])`` fails, you can add
    ``@example(n=[0, math.nan])`` to your test to quickly reproduce that failure.

    Arguments to ``@example``
    -------------------------

    Arguments to |@example| have the same behavior and restrictions as arguments
    to |@given|. This means they may be either positional or keyword arguments
    (but not both in the same |@example|):

    .. code-block:: python

        @example(1, 2)
        @example(x=1, y=2)
        @given(st.integers(), st.integers())
        def test(x, y):
            pass

    Noting that while arguments to |@given| are strategies (like |st.integers|),
    arguments to |@example| are values instead (like ``1``).

    See the :ref:`given-arguments` section for full details.

    The |@given| decorator turns a function into a Hypothesis test. This is the
    main entry point to Hypothesis.

    .. seealso::

        See also the :doc:`/tutorial/introduction` tutorial, which introduces
        defining Hypothesis tests with |@given|.

    .. _given-arguments:

    Arguments to ``@given``
    -----------------------

    Arguments to |@given| may be either positional or keyword arguments:

    .. code-block:: python

        @given(st.integers(), st.floats())
        def test_one(x, y):
            pass

        @given(x=st.integers(), y=st.floats())
        def test_two(x, y):
            pass

    If using keyword arguments, the arguments may appear in any order, as with
    standard Python functions:

    .. code-block:: python

        # different order, but still equivalent to before
        @given(y=st.floats(), x=st.integers())
        def test(x, y):
            assert isinstance(x, int)
            assert isinstance(y, float)

    If |@given| is provided fewer positional arguments than the decorated test,
    the test arguments are filled in on the right side, leaving the leftmost
    positional arguments unfilled:

    .. code-block:: python

        @given(st.integers(), st.floats())
        def test(manual_string, y, z):
            assert manual_string == "x"
            assert isinstance(y, int)
            assert isinstance(z, float)

        # `test` is now a callable which takes one argument `manual_string`

        test("x")
        # or equivalently:
        test(manual_string="x")

    The reason for this "from the right" behavior is to support using |@given|
    with instance methods, by automatically passing through ``self``:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyTest(TestCase):
            @given(st.integers())
            def test(self, x):
                assert isinstance(self, MyTest)
                assert isinstance(x, int)

    If (and only if) using keyword arguments, |@given| may be combined with
    ``**kwargs`` or ``*args``:

    .. code-block:: python

        @given(x=integers(), y=integers())
        def test(x, **kwargs):
            assert "y" in kwargs

        @given(x=integers(), y=integers())
        def test(x, *args, **kwargs):
