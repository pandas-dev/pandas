Introduction
------------

The API is designed to be nearly identical to the built-in ``functools.cached_property`` class,
except for the additional ``under_cached_property`` class which uses ``self._cache``
instead of ``self.__dict__`` to store the cached values and prevents ``__set__`` from being called.

For full documentation please read https://propcache.readthedocs.io.

Installation
------------

::

   $ pip install propcache

The library is Python 3 only!

PyPI contains binary wheels for Linux, Windows and MacOS.  If you want to install
``propcache`` on another operating system where wheels are not provided,
the the tarball will be used to compile the library from
the source code. It requires a C compiler and and Python headers installed.

To skip the compilation you must explicitly opt-in by using a PEP 517
configuration setting ``pure-python``, or setting the ``PROPCACHE_NO_EXTENSIONS``
environment variable to a non-empty value, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install propcache --config-settings=pure-python=false

Please note that the pure-Python (uncompiled) version is much slower. However,
PyPy always uses a pure-Python implementation, and, as such, it is unaffected
by this variable.

0.3.2
=====

*(2025-06-09)*


Improved documentation
----------------------

- Fixed incorrect decorator usage in the ``~propcache.api.under_cached_property`` example code -- by `@meanmail <https://github.com/sponsors/meanmail>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#109 <https://github.com/aio-libs/propcache/issues/109>`__.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- Updated to use Cython 3.1 universally across the build path -- by `@lysnikolaou <https://github.com/sponsors/lysnikolaou>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#117 <https://github.com/aio-libs/propcache/issues/117>`__.

- Made Cython line tracing opt-in via the ``with-cython-tracing`` build config setting -- by `@bdraco <https://github.com/sponsors/bdraco>`__.

  Previously, line tracing was enabled by default in ``pyproject.toml``, which caused build issues for some users and made wheels nearly twice as slow.

  Now line tracing is only enabled when explicitly requested via ``pip install . --config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true`` or by setting the ``PROPCACHE_CYTHON_TRACING`` environment variable.

  version of Python runtime.
