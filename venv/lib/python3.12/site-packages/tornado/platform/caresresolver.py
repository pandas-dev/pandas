    """Name resolver based on the c-ares library.

    This is a non-blocking and non-threaded resolver.  It may not produce the
    same results as the system resolver, but can be used for non-blocking
    resolution when threads cannot be used.

    ``pycares`` will not return a mix of ``AF_INET`` and ``AF_INET6`` when
    ``family`` is ``AF_UNSPEC``, so it is only recommended for use in
    ``AF_INET`` (i.e. IPv4).  This is the default for
    ``tornado.simple_httpclient``, but other libraries may default to
    ``AF_UNSPEC``.

    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.

    .. deprecated:: 6.2
       This class is deprecated and will be removed in Tornado 7.0. Use the default
       thread-based resolver instead.
