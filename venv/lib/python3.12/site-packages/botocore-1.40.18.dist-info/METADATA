A low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web Services. The
botocore package is the foundation for the

`boto3 <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`__.

Botocore is maintained and published by `Amazon Web Services`_.

Notices
-------

On 2025-04-22, support for Python 3.8 ended for Botocore. This follows the
Python Software Foundation `end of support <https://peps.python.org/pep-0569/#lifespan>`__
for the runtime which occurred on 2024-10-07.

Getting Started
---------------
Assuming that you have Python and ``virtualenv`` installed, set up your environment and install the required dependencies like this or you can install the library using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/boto/botocore.git
    $ cd botocore
    $ python -m venv .venv
    ...
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python -m pip install -e .

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install botocore

Using Botocore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After installing botocore

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.aws/credentials``):

.. code-block:: ini

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET

Then, set up a default region (in e.g. ``~/.aws/config``):

.. code-block:: ini

   [default]
   region=us-east-1

Other credentials configuration method can be found `here <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>`__

Then, from a Python interpreter:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import botocore.session
    >>> session = botocore.session.get_session()
    >>> client = session.create_client('ec2')
    >>> print(client.describe_instances())
