Design
================================================================================

TODO: first step: forget about lazyness and performance.

Fundamental object: Query. NO, see below

  - Query defined independently of the root(s) it will be applied to.

  - Query is a callable ? Once defined, applied with `query(doc)` for
    example ? Or stuff = query(doc) is the aim is some extraction ?
    Or for item in query(doc): do_stuff_with(item). Root(s?) can be
    a Pandoc item or a list or tuple of stuff, etc.
    
    Could also envision query methods directly on Pandoc Elements ...
    dunno, have to think of it. Would be convenient (shorter code), 
    but messy (Elements are not "algebraic datatypes" anymore).

  - Query construction uses chaining (fluent) interface : chaining of
    transforms, chaining of filters, etc.

  - Query definition is lazy, does not compute anything: just abstract
    description of what we intend to do.

  - Query applied to a root : by default all items (in doc order)

  - Query filters: may reduce the list of items. Chaining is an "AND" thus
    a single-filter should be likely "OR"-based. E.g.
    query.filter((Para, Plain)) means keep Para OR Plain.
    Possible filters : filter(types), filter(predicate), has_attr(...),
    id_is(id=...), etc. Need to have stuff to match the existence of a feature
    has well as its value (ex: has id vs id is "main"). Also, class matching,
    etc. Essentially, many syntaxic sugar on top of "filter(predicate)".
    May need a meta stuff: .either(pred1, pred2, ...) ? Have a look at
    shader graph to see how stuff is forked/join with such interfaces.

  - Navigation: .parent, .children, .next_sibling, get_item[i]. Extract a 
    general "navigate" function such that all that stuff is merely syntaxic
    sugar ?

  - Mutation: .remove(), .replace_with(stuff), etc. Probably complex to get it
    right here. All this stuff should be TERMINAL : if any, nothing can be
    chained after that. Also: set attributes, ids, etc.
    Again, can we come up with a single, root, general mutation operation ?
    Or is it too complex here?
    Apply mutation in reverse order by default?

  - Iteration ? Query as a container "removes" path info by default so that
    we can deal with a list of "document items", make comprehensions, etc.


New Take
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - We have PREDICATES first: stuff that takes an elt and returns a bool.

  - We have a list of "fancy", parametrized predicates (match the id, match
    the type, etc.).

  - Predicates are functions (elt -> True) that have some extra support for
    |, & and ~ (and/or the or_, and_ and not_ methods?). But not that a
    "filter" method (or __call__) on Elements/Collections could/does work
    as a "and", so multiple args in () could work has a "or" and we merely
    need a not to be complete (we have a conjonctive normal form).

  - On an elt or a collection of elements, we can either query using a 
    predicate or filter using a predicate. Query is get everything + filter.
    Have a look at rethinkdb for the terminology? And/or pandas?
    Terminology: "run" a query. Rethinkdb uses a chain with "." + final "run()"
    to get the results of a query that runs.
    In db-land, there is an iteration by default?
    But not a recursive structure ... JQuery would be a better reference I 
    guess, because of its tree structure.

    The find vs filter distinction is more JQuery-ish.


  - Anyway, we have a elts + predicates -> elts function, that we should be
    able to chain.

  - Also, transforms (elts -> elts, such a .children) and apply (returns
    anything).
