An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

[JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) offering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface.

JupyterLab can be extended using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
that use our public APIs. The _prebuilt_ extensions can be distributed
via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=jupyterlab&o=-created&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter),
conda, and other package managers. The _source_ extensions can be installed
directly from npm (search for [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension)) but require an additional build step.
You can also find JupyterLab extensions exploring GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension).
To learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).

Read the current JupyterLab documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> JupyterLab 3 reached its end of maintenance date on May 15, 2024. Fixes for critical issues will still be backported until December 31, 2024. If you are still running JupyterLab 3, we strongly encourage you to **upgrade to JupyterLab 4 as soon as possible.** For more information, see [JupyterLab 3 end of maintenance](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-3-end-of-maintenance-879778927db2) on the Jupyter Blog.

## Getting started

### Installation

If you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), you can install JupyterLab with one of the following commands.

- If you use conda:
  ```shell
  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
  ```
- If you use mamba:
  ```shell
  mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
  ```
- If you use pip:
  ```shell
  pip install jupyterlab
  ```
  If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. If you are using a Unix derivative (e.g., FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, macOS), you can do this by running `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`.

For more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook

When using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run after installing JupyterLab to enable the JupyterLab server extension:

```bash
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix
```

### Running

Start up JupyterLab using:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.

If you encounter an error like "Command 'jupyter' not found", please make sure `PATH` environment variable is set correctly. Alternatively, you can start up JupyterLab using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab` without changing the `PATH` environment variable.

### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers

The latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari

See our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.

## Getting help

We encourage you to ask questions on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.

### Bug report

To report a bug please read the [guidelines](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/issue.html) and then open a [Github issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+status%3ANeeds+Triage&template=bug_report.md). To keep resolved issues self-contained, the [lock bot](https://github.com/apps/lock) will lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. If a related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.

### Feature request

We also welcome suggestions for new features as they help make the project more useful for everyone. To request a feature please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=enhancement%2C+status%3ANeeds+Triage&template=feature_request.md).
