    Custom Registry that returns requests in an order that makes sense for Moto:
     - Implemented callbacks take precedence over non-implemented-callbacks
     - CallbackResponses are not discarded after first use - users can mock the same URL as often as they like
     - CallbackResponses are persisted in a dictionary, with the request-method as key
       This reduces the number of possible responses that we need to search
