.. _mutable_scalars:

Establishing Mutability on Scalar Column Values
===============================================

A typical example of a "mutable" structure is a Python dictionary.
Following the example introduced in :ref:`types_toplevel`, we
begin with a custom type that marshals Python dictionaries into
JSON strings before being persisted::

    from sqlalchemy.types import TypeDecorator, VARCHAR
    import json


    class JSONEncodedDict(TypeDecorator):
        "Represents an immutable structure as a json-encoded string."

        impl = VARCHAR

        def process_bind_param(self, value, dialect):
            if value is not None:
                value = json.dumps(value)
            return value

        def process_result_value(self, value, dialect):
            if value is not None:
                value = json.loads(value)
            return value

The usage of ``json`` is only for the purposes of example. The
:mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension can be used
with any type whose target Python type may be mutable, including
:class:`.PickleType`, :class:`_postgresql.ARRAY`, etc.

When using the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension, the value itself
tracks all parents which reference it.  Below, we illustrate a simple
version of the :class:`.MutableDict` dictionary object, which applies
the :class:`.Mutable` mixin to a plain Python dictionary::

    from sqlalchemy.ext.mutable import Mutable


    class MutableDict(Mutable, dict):
        @classmethod
        def coerce(cls, key, value):
            "Convert plain dictionaries to MutableDict."

            if not isinstance(value, MutableDict):
                if isinstance(value, dict):
                    return MutableDict(value)

                # this call will raise ValueError
                return Mutable.coerce(key, value)
            else:
                return value

        def __setitem__(self, key, value):
            "Detect dictionary set events and emit change events."

            dict.__setitem__(self, key, value)
            self.changed()

        def __delitem__(self, key):
            "Detect dictionary del events and emit change events."

            dict.__delitem__(self, key)
            self.changed()

The above dictionary class takes the approach of subclassing the Python
built-in ``dict`` to produce a dict
subclass which routes all mutation events through ``__setitem__``.  There are
variants on this approach, such as subclassing ``UserDict.UserDict`` or
``collections.MutableMapping``; the part that's important to this example is
that the :meth:`.Mutable.changed` method is called whenever an in-place
change to the datastructure takes place.

We also redefine the :meth:`.Mutable.coerce` method which will be used to
convert any values that are not instances of ``MutableDict``, such
as the plain dictionaries returned by the ``json`` module, into the
appropriate type.  Defining this method is optional; we could just as well
created our ``JSONEncodedDict`` such that it always returns an instance
of ``MutableDict``, and additionally ensured that all calling code
uses ``MutableDict`` explicitly.  When :meth:`.Mutable.coerce` is not
overridden, any values applied to a parent object which are not instances
of the mutable type will raise a ``ValueError``.

Our new ``MutableDict`` type offers a class method
:meth:`~.Mutable.as_mutable` which we can use within column metadata
to associate with types. This method grabs the given type object or
class and associates a listener that will detect all future mappings
of this type, applying event listening instrumentation to the mapped
attribute. Such as, with classical table metadata::

    from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer

    my_data = Table(
        "my_data",
        metadata,
        Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column("data", MutableDict.as_mutable(JSONEncodedDict)),
    )

Above, :meth:`~.Mutable.as_mutable` returns an instance of ``JSONEncodedDict``
(if the type object was not an instance already), which will intercept any
attributes which are mapped against this type.  Below we establish a simple
mapping against the ``my_data`` table::

    from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped
    from sqlalchemy.orm import mapped_column


    class Base(DeclarativeBase):
        pass


    class MyDataClass(Base):
        __tablename__ = "my_data"
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
        data: Mapped[dict[str, str]] = mapped_column(
            MutableDict.as_mutable(JSONEncodedDict)
        )

The ``MyDataClass.data`` member will now be notified of in place changes
to its value.

Any in-place changes to the ``MyDataClass.data`` member
will flag the attribute as "dirty" on the parent object::

    >>> from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

    >>> sess = Session(some_engine)
    >>> m1 = MyDataClass(data={"value1": "foo"})
    >>> sess.add(m1)
    >>> sess.commit()

    >>> m1.data["value1"] = "bar"
    >>> assert m1 in sess.dirty
    True

The ``MutableDict`` can be associated with all future instances
of ``JSONEncodedDict`` in one step, using
:meth:`~.Mutable.associate_with`.  This is similar to
:meth:`~.Mutable.as_mutable` except it will intercept all occurrences
of ``MutableDict`` in all mappings unconditionally, without
the need to declare it individually::

    from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped
    from sqlalchemy.orm import mapped_column

    MutableDict.associate_with(JSONEncodedDict)


    class Base(DeclarativeBase):
        pass


    class MyDataClass(Base):
        __tablename__ = "my_data"
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
        data: Mapped[dict[str, str]] = mapped_column(JSONEncodedDict)

Supporting Pickling
--------------------

The key to the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension relies upon the
placement of a ``weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`` upon the value object, which
stores a mapping of parent mapped objects keyed to the attribute name under
which they are associated with this value. ``WeakKeyDictionary`` objects are
not picklable, due to the fact that they contain weakrefs and function
callbacks. In our case, this is a good thing, since if this dictionary were
picklable, it could lead to an excessively large pickle size for our value
objects that are pickled by themselves outside of the context of the parent.
The developer responsibility here is only to provide a ``__getstate__`` method
that excludes the :meth:`~MutableBase._parents` collection from the pickle
stream::

    class MyMutableType(Mutable):
        def __getstate__(self):
            d = self.__dict__.copy()
            d.pop("_parents", None)
            return d

With our dictionary example, we need to return the contents of the dict itself
(and also restore them on __setstate__)::

    class MutableDict(Mutable, dict):
        # ....

        def __getstate__(self):
            return dict(self)

        def __setstate__(self, state):
            self.update(state)

In the case that our mutable value object is pickled as it is attached to one
or more parent objects that are also part of the pickle, the :class:`.Mutable`
mixin will re-establish the :attr:`.Mutable._parents` collection on each value
object as the owning parents themselves are unpickled.

Receiving Events
----------------

The :meth:`.AttributeEvents.modified` event handler may be used to receive
an event when a mutable scalar emits a change event.  This event handler
is called when the :func:`.attributes.flag_modified` function is called
from within the mutable extension::

    from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped
    from sqlalchemy.orm import mapped_column
    from sqlalchemy import event


    class Base(DeclarativeBase):
        pass


    class MyDataClass(Base):
        __tablename__ = "my_data"
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
        data: Mapped[dict[str, str]] = mapped_column(
            MutableDict.as_mutable(JSONEncodedDict)
        )


    @event.listens_for(MyDataClass.data, "modified")
    def modified_json(instance, initiator):
        print("json value modified:", instance.data)

.. _mutable_composites:

Establishing Mutability on Composites
=====================================

Composites are a special ORM feature which allow a single scalar attribute to
be assigned an object value which represents information "composed" from one
or more columns from the underlying mapped table. The usual example is that of
a geometric "point", and is introduced in :ref:`mapper_composite`.

As is the case with :class:`.Mutable`, the user-defined composite class
subclasses :class:`.MutableComposite` as a mixin, and detects and delivers
change events to its parents via the :meth:`.MutableComposite.changed` method.
In the case of a composite class, the detection is usually via the usage of the
special Python method ``__setattr__()``. In the example below, we expand upon the ``Point``
class introduced in :ref:`mapper_composite` to include
:class:`.MutableComposite` in its bases and to route attribute set events via
``__setattr__`` to the :meth:`.MutableComposite.changed` method::

    import dataclasses
    from sqlalchemy.ext.mutable import MutableComposite


    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class Point(MutableComposite):
        x: int
        y: int

        def __setattr__(self, key, value):
            "Intercept set events"

            # set the attribute
            object.__setattr__(self, key, value)

            # alert all parents to the change
            self.changed()

The :class:`.MutableComposite` class makes use of class mapping events to
automatically establish listeners for any usage of :func:`_orm.composite` that
specifies our ``Point`` type. Below, when ``Point`` is mapped to the ``Vertex``
class, listeners are established which will route change events from ``Point``
objects to each of the ``Vertex.start`` and ``Vertex.end`` attributes::

    from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped
    from sqlalchemy.orm import composite, mapped_column


    class Base(DeclarativeBase):
        pass


    class Vertex(Base):
        __tablename__ = "vertices"

        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)

        start: Mapped[Point] = composite(
            mapped_column("x1"), mapped_column("y1")
        )
        end: Mapped[Point] = composite(
            mapped_column("x2"), mapped_column("y2")
        )

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"Vertex(start={self.start}, end={self.end})"

Any in-place changes to the ``Vertex.start`` or ``Vertex.end`` members
will flag the attribute as "dirty" on the parent object:

.. sourcecode:: python+sql

    >>> from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
    >>> sess = Session(engine)
    >>> v1 = Vertex(start=Point(3, 4), end=Point(12, 15))
    >>> sess.add(v1)
    {sql}>>> sess.flush()
    BEGIN (implicit)
    INSERT INTO vertices (x1, y1, x2, y2) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
    [...] (3, 4, 12, 15)

    {stop}>>> v1.end.x = 8
    >>> assert v1 in sess.dirty
    True
    {sql}>>> sess.commit()
    UPDATE vertices SET x2=? WHERE vertices.id = ?
    [...] (8, 1)
    COMMIT

Coercing Mutable Composites
---------------------------

The :meth:`.MutableBase.coerce` method is also supported on composite types.
In the case of :class:`.MutableComposite`, the :meth:`.MutableBase.coerce`
method is only called for attribute set operations, not load operations.
Overriding the :meth:`.MutableBase.coerce` method is essentially equivalent
to using a :func:`.validates` validation routine for all attributes which
make use of the custom composite type::

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class Point(MutableComposite):
        # other Point methods
        # ...

        def coerce(cls, key, value):
            if isinstance(value, tuple):
                value = Point(*value)
            elif not isinstance(value, Point):
                raise ValueError("tuple or Point expected")
            return value

Supporting Pickling
--------------------

As is the case with :class:`.Mutable`, the :class:`.MutableComposite` helper
class uses a ``weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`` available via the
:meth:`MutableBase._parents` attribute which isn't picklable. If we need to
pickle instances of ``Point`` or its owning class ``Vertex``, we at least need
to define a ``__getstate__`` that doesn't include the ``_parents`` dictionary.
Below we define both a ``__getstate__`` and a ``__setstate__`` that package up
the minimal form of our ``Point`` class::

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class Point(MutableComposite):
        # ...

        def __getstate__(self):
            return self.x, self.y

        def __setstate__(self, state):
            self.x, self.y = state

As with :class:`.Mutable`, the :class:`.MutableComposite` augments the
pickling process of the parent's object-relational state so that the
:meth:`MutableBase._parents` collection is restored to all ``Point`` objects.
