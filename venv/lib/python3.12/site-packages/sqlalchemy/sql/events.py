class DDLEvents(event.Events[SchemaEventTarget]):
    """
    Define event listeners for schema objects,
    that is, :class:`.SchemaItem` and other :class:`.SchemaEventTarget`
    subclasses, including :class:`_schema.MetaData`, :class:`_schema.Table`,
    :class:`_schema.Column`, etc.

    **Create / Drop Events**

    Events emitted when CREATE and DROP commands are emitted to the database.
    The event hooks in this category include :meth:`.DDLEvents.before_create`,
    :meth:`.DDLEvents.after_create`, :meth:`.DDLEvents.before_drop`, and
    :meth:`.DDLEvents.after_drop`.

    These events are emitted when using schema-level methods such as
    :meth:`.MetaData.create_all` and :meth:`.MetaData.drop_all`. Per-object
    create/drop methods such as :meth:`.Table.create`, :meth:`.Table.drop`,
    :meth:`.Index.create` are also included, as well as dialect-specific
    methods such as :meth:`_postgresql.ENUM.create`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0 :class:`.DDLEvents` event hooks now take place
       for non-table objects including constraints, indexes, and
       dialect-specific schema types.

    Event hooks may be attached directly to a :class:`_schema.Table` object or
    to a :class:`_schema.MetaData` collection, as well as to any
    :class:`.SchemaItem` class or object that can be individually created and
    dropped using a distinct SQL command. Such classes include :class:`.Index`,
    :class:`.Sequence`, and dialect-specific classes such as
    :class:`_postgresql.ENUM`.

    Example using the :meth:`.DDLEvents.after_create` event, where a custom
    event hook will emit an ``ALTER TABLE`` command on the current connection,
    after ``CREATE TABLE`` is emitted::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        from sqlalchemy import event
        from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Metadata, Integer

        m = MetaData()
        some_table = Table("some_table", m, Column("data", Integer))


        @event.listens_for(some_table, "after_create")
        def after_create(target, connection, **kw):
            connection.execute(
                text("ALTER TABLE %s SET name=foo_%s" % (target.name, target.name))
            )


        some_engine = create_engine("postgresql://scott:tiger@host/test")

        # will emit "CREATE TABLE some_table" as well as the above
        # "ALTER TABLE" statement afterwards
        m.create_all(some_engine)

    Constraint objects such as :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint`,
    :class:`.UniqueConstraint`, :class:`.CheckConstraint` may also be
    subscribed to these events, however they will **not** normally produce
    events as these objects are usually rendered inline within an
    enclosing ``CREATE TABLE`` statement and implicitly dropped from a
    ``DROP TABLE`` statement.

    For the :class:`.Index` construct, the event hook will be emitted
    for ``CREATE INDEX``, however SQLAlchemy does not normally emit
    ``DROP INDEX`` when dropping tables as this is again implicit within the
    ``DROP TABLE`` statement.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0 Support for :class:`.SchemaItem` objects
       for create/drop events was expanded from its previous support for
       :class:`.MetaData` and :class:`.Table` to also include
       :class:`.Constraint` and all subclasses, :class:`.Index`,
       :class:`.Sequence` and some type-related constructs such as
       :class:`_postgresql.ENUM`.

    .. note:: These event hooks are only emitted within the scope of
       SQLAlchemy's create/drop methods; they are not necessarily supported
       by tools such as `alembic <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org>`_.


    **Attachment Events**

    Attachment events are provided to customize
    behavior whenever a child schema element is associated
    with a parent, such as when a :class:`_schema.Column` is associated
    with its :class:`_schema.Table`, when a
    :class:`_schema.ForeignKeyConstraint`
    is associated with a :class:`_schema.Table`, etc.  These events include
    :meth:`.DDLEvents.before_parent_attach` and
    :meth:`.DDLEvents.after_parent_attach`.

    **Reflection Events**

    The :meth:`.DDLEvents.column_reflect` event is used to intercept
    and modify the in-Python definition of database columns when
    :term:`reflection` of database tables proceeds.

    **Use with Generic DDL**

    DDL events integrate closely with the
    :class:`.DDL` class and the :class:`.ExecutableDDLElement` hierarchy
    of DDL clause constructs, which are themselves appropriate
    as listener callables::

        from sqlalchemy import DDL

        event.listen(
            some_table,
            "after_create",
            DDL("ALTER TABLE %(table)s SET name=foo_%(table)s"),
        )

    **Event Propagation to MetaData Copies**

    For all :class:`.DDLEvent` events, the ``propagate=True`` keyword argument
    will ensure that a given event handler is propagated to copies of the
    object, which are made when using the :meth:`_schema.Table.to_metadata`
    method::

        from sqlalchemy import DDL

        metadata = MetaData()
        some_table = Table("some_table", metadata, Column("data", Integer))

        event.listen(
            some_table,
            "after_create",
            DDL("ALTER TABLE %(table)s SET name=foo_%(table)s"),
            propagate=True,
        )

        new_metadata = MetaData()
        new_table = some_table.to_metadata(new_metadata)

    The above :class:`.DDL` object will be associated with the
    :meth:`.DDLEvents.after_create` event for both the ``some_table`` and
    the ``new_table`` :class:`.Table` objects.

            )

        The dictionary of column information as returned by the
        dialect is passed, and can be modified.  The dictionary
        is that returned in each element of the list returned
        by :meth:`.reflection.Inspector.get_columns`:

            * ``name`` - the column's name, is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.name` parameter

            * ``type`` - the type of this column, which should be an instance
              of :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.TypeEngine`, is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.type` parameter

            * ``nullable`` - boolean flag if the column is NULL or NOT NULL,
              is applied to the :paramref:`_schema.Column.nullable` parameter

            * ``default`` - the column's server default value.  This is
              normally specified as a plain string SQL expression, however the
              event can pass a :class:`.FetchedValue`, :class:`.DefaultClause`,
              or :func:`_expression.text` object as well.  Is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.server_default` parameter

        The event is called before any action is taken against
        this dictionary, and the contents can be modified; the following
        additional keys may be added to the dictionary to further modify
        how the :class:`_schema.Column` is constructed:


            * ``key`` - the string key that will be used to access this
              :class:`_schema.Column` in the ``.c`` collection; will be applied
              to the :paramref:`_schema.Column.key` parameter. Is also used
              for ORM mapping.  See the section
              :ref:`mapper_automated_reflection_schemes` for an example.

            * ``quote`` - force or un-force quoting on the column name;
              is applied to the :paramref:`_schema.Column.quote` parameter.

            * ``info`` - a dictionary of arbitrary data to follow along with
              the :class:`_schema.Column`, is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.info` parameter.

        :func:`.event.listen` also accepts the ``propagate=True``
        modifier for this event; when True, the listener function will
