    The return value is an instance of :class:`.BindParameter`; this
    is a :class:`_expression.ColumnElement`
    subclass which represents a so-called
    "placeholder" value in a SQL expression, the value of which is
    supplied at the point at which the statement in executed against a
    database connection.

    In SQLAlchemy, the :func:`.bindparam` construct has
    the ability to carry along the actual value that will be ultimately
    used at expression time.  In this way, it serves not just as
    a "placeholder" for eventual population, but also as a means of
    representing so-called "unsafe" values which should not be rendered
    directly in a SQL statement, but rather should be passed along
    to the :term:`DBAPI` as values which need to be correctly escaped
    and potentially handled for type-safety.

    When using :func:`.bindparam` explicitly, the use case is typically
    one of traditional deferment of parameters; the :func:`.bindparam`
    construct accepts a name which can then be referred to at execution
    time::

        from sqlalchemy import bindparam

        stmt = select(users_table).where(
            users_table.c.name == bindparam("username")
        )

    The above statement, when rendered, will produce SQL similar to:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        SELECT id, name FROM user WHERE name = :username

    In order to populate the value of ``:username`` above, the value
    would typically be applied at execution time to a method
    like :meth:`_engine.Connection.execute`::

        result = connection.execute(stmt, {"username": "wendy"})

    Explicit use of :func:`.bindparam` is also common when producing
    UPDATE or DELETE statements that are to be invoked multiple times,
    where the WHERE criterion of the statement is to change on each
    invocation, such as::

        stmt = (
            users_table.update()
            .where(user_table.c.name == bindparam("username"))
            .values(fullname=bindparam("fullname"))
        )

        connection.execute(
            stmt,
            [
                {"username": "wendy", "fullname": "Wendy Smith"},
                {"username": "jack", "fullname": "Jack Jones"},
            ],
        )

    SQLAlchemy's Core expression system makes wide use of
    :func:`.bindparam` in an implicit sense.   It is typical that Python
    literal values passed to virtually all SQL expression functions are
    coerced into fixed :func:`.bindparam` constructs.  For example, given
    a comparison operation such as::

        expr = users_table.c.name == "Wendy"

    The above expression will produce a :class:`.BinaryExpression`
    construct, where the left side is the :class:`_schema.Column` object
    representing the ``name`` column, and the right side is a
    :class:`.BindParameter` representing the literal value::

        print(repr(expr.right))
        BindParameter("%(4327771088 name)s", "Wendy", type_=String())

    The expression above will render SQL such as:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        user.name = :name_1

    Where the ``:name_1`` parameter name is an anonymous name.  The
    actual string ``Wendy`` is not in the rendered string, but is carried
    along where it is later used within statement execution.  If we
    invoke a statement like the following::

        stmt = select(users_table).where(users_table.c.name == "Wendy")
        result = connection.execute(stmt)

    We would see SQL logging output as:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        SELECT "user".id, "user".name
        FROM "user"
        WHERE "user".name = %(name_1)s
        {'name_1': 'Wendy'}

    Above, we see that ``Wendy`` is passed as a parameter to the database,
    while the placeholder ``:name_1`` is rendered in the appropriate form
    for the target database, in this case the PostgreSQL database.

    Similarly, :func:`.bindparam` is invoked automatically when working
    with :term:`CRUD` statements as far as the "VALUES" portion is
    concerned.   The :func:`_expression.insert` construct produces an
    ``INSERT`` expression which will, at statement execution time, generate
    bound placeholders based on the arguments passed, as in::

        stmt = users_table.insert()
        result = connection.execute(stmt, {"name": "Wendy"})

    The above will produce SQL output as:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        INSERT INTO "user" (name) VALUES (%(name)s)
        {'name': 'Wendy'}

    The :class:`_expression.Insert` construct, at
    compilation/execution time, rendered a single :func:`.bindparam`
    mirroring the column name ``name`` as a result of the single ``name``
    parameter we passed to the :meth:`_engine.Connection.execute` method.

    :param key:
      the key (e.g. the name) for this bind param.
      Will be used in the generated
      SQL statement for dialects that use named parameters.  This
      value may be modified when part of a compilation operation,
      if other :class:`BindParameter` objects exist with the same
      key, or if its length is too long and truncation is
      required.

      If omitted, an "anonymous" name is generated for the bound parameter;
      when given a value to bind, the end result is equivalent to calling upon
      the :func:`.literal` function with a value to bind, particularly
      if the :paramref:`.bindparam.unique` parameter is also provided.

    :param value:
      Initial value for this bind param.  Will be used at statement
      execution time as the value for this parameter passed to the
      DBAPI, if no other value is indicated to the statement execution
      method for this particular parameter name.  Defaults to ``None``.

    :param callable\_:
      A callable function that takes the place of "value".  The function
      will be called at statement execution time to determine the
      ultimate value.   Used for scenarios where the actual bind
      value cannot be determined at the point at which the clause
      construct is created, but embedded bind values are still desirable.

    :param type\_:
      A :class:`.TypeEngine` class or instance representing an optional
      datatype for this :func:`.bindparam`.  If not passed, a type
      may be determined automatically for the bind, based on the given
      value; for example, trivial Python types such as ``str``,
      ``int``, ``bool``
      may result in the :class:`.String`, :class:`.Integer` or
      :class:`.Boolean` types being automatically selected.

      The type of a :func:`.bindparam` is significant especially in that
      the type will apply pre-processing to the value before it is
      passed to the database.  For example, a :func:`.bindparam` which
      refers to a datetime value, and is specified as holding the
      :class:`.DateTime` type, may apply conversion needed to the
      value (such as stringification on SQLite) before passing the value
      to the database.

    :param unique:
      if True, the key name of this :class:`.BindParameter` will be
      modified if another :class:`.BindParameter` of the same name
      already has been located within the containing
      expression.  This flag is used generally by the internals
      when producing so-called "anonymous" bound expressions, it
      isn't generally applicable to explicitly-named :func:`.bindparam`
      constructs.

    :param required:
      If ``True``, a value is required at execution time.  If not passed,
      it defaults to ``True`` if neither :paramref:`.bindparam.value`
      or :paramref:`.bindparam.callable` were passed.  If either of these
      parameters are present, then :paramref:`.bindparam.required`
      defaults to ``False``.

    :param quote:
      True if this parameter name requires quoting and is not
      currently known as a SQLAlchemy reserved word; this currently
      only applies to the Oracle Database backends, where bound names must
      sometimes be quoted.

    :param isoutparam:
      if True, the parameter should be treated like a stored procedure
      "OUT" parameter.  This applies to backends such as Oracle Database which

    :param expanding:
      if True, this parameter will be treated as an "expanding" parameter
      at execution time; the parameter value is expected to be a sequence,
      rather than a scalar value, and the string SQL statement will
      be transformed on a per-execution basis to accommodate the sequence
      with a variable number of parameter slots passed to the DBAPI.
      This is to allow statement caching to be used in conjunction with
      an IN clause.

      .. versionchanged:: 1.3 the "expanding" bound parameter feature now
         supports empty lists.

    :param literal_execute:
      if True, the bound parameter will be rendered in the compile phase
      with a special "POSTCOMPILE" token, and the SQLAlchemy compiler will
      render the final value of the parameter into the SQL statement at
      statement execution time, omitting the value from the parameter
      dictionary / list passed to DBAPI ``cursor.execute()``.  This
      produces a similar effect as that of using the ``literal_binds``,
      compilation flag,  however takes place as the statement is sent to
      the DBAPI ``cursor.execute()`` method, rather than when the statement
      is compiled.   The primary use of this
      capability is for rendering LIMIT / OFFSET clauses for database
      drivers that can't accommodate for bound parameters in these
      contexts, while allowing SQL constructs to be cacheable at the
      compilation level.

    r"""Produce a ``CASE`` expression.

    The ``CASE`` construct in SQL is a conditional object that
    acts somewhat analogously to an "if/then" construct in other
    languages.  It returns an instance of :class:`.Case`.

    :func:`.case` in its usual form is passed a series of "when"
    constructs, that is, a list of conditions and results as tuples::

        from sqlalchemy import case

        stmt = select(users_table).where(
            case(
                (users_table.c.name == "wendy", "W"),
                (users_table.c.name == "jack", "J"),
                else_="E",
            )
        )

    The above statement will produce SQL resembling:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        SELECT id, name FROM user
        WHERE CASE
            WHEN (name = :name_1) THEN :param_1
            WHEN (name = :name_2) THEN :param_2
            ELSE :param_3
        END

    When simple equality expressions of several values against a single
    parent column are needed, :func:`.case` also has a "shorthand" format
    used via the
    :paramref:`.case.value` parameter, which is passed a column
    expression to be compared.  In this form, the :paramref:`.case.whens`
    parameter is passed as a dictionary containing expressions to be
    compared against keyed to result expressions.  The statement below is
    equivalent to the preceding statement::

        stmt = select(users_table).where(
            case({"wendy": "W", "jack": "J"}, value=users_table.c.name, else_="E")
        )

    The values which are accepted as result values in
    :paramref:`.case.whens` as well as with :paramref:`.case.else_` are
    coerced from Python literals into :func:`.bindparam` constructs.
    SQL expressions, e.g. :class:`_expression.ColumnElement` constructs,
    are accepted
    as well.  To coerce a literal string expression into a constant
    expression rendered inline, use the :func:`_expression.literal_column`
    construct,
    as in::

        from sqlalchemy import case, literal_column

        case(
            (orderline.c.qty > 100, literal_column("'greaterthan100'")),
            (orderline.c.qty > 10, literal_column("'greaterthan10'")),
            else_=literal_column("'lessthan10'"),
        )

    The above will render the given constants without using bound
    parameters for the result values (but still for the comparison
    values), as in:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        CASE
            WHEN (orderline.qty > :qty_1) THEN 'greaterthan100'
            WHEN (orderline.qty > :qty_2) THEN 'greaterthan10'
            ELSE 'lessthan10'
        END

    :param \*whens: The criteria to be compared against,
     :paramref:`.case.whens` accepts two different forms, based on
     whether or not :paramref:`.case.value` is used.

     .. versionchanged:: 1.4 the :func:`_sql.case`
        function now accepts the series of WHEN conditions positionally

     In the first form, it accepts multiple 2-tuples passed as positional
     arguments; each 2-tuple consists of ``(<sql expression>, <value>)``,
     where the SQL expression is a boolean expression and "value" is a
     resulting value, e.g.::

        case(
            (users_table.c.name == "wendy", "W"),
            (users_table.c.name == "jack", "J"),
        )

     In the second form, it accepts a Python dictionary of comparison
     values mapped to a resulting value; this form requires
     :paramref:`.case.value` to be present, and values will be compared
     using the ``==`` operator, e.g.::

        case({"wendy": "W", "jack": "J"}, value=users_table.c.name)

    :param value: An optional SQL expression which will be used as a
      fixed "comparison point" for candidate values within a dictionary
      passed to :paramref:`.case.whens`.

    :param else\_: An optional SQL expression which will be the evaluated
      result of the ``CASE`` construct if all expressions within
      :paramref:`.case.whens` evaluate to false.  When omitted, most
      databases will produce a result of NULL if none of the "when"
      expressions evaluate to true.

    The above statement will produce SQL resembling:

    .. sourcecode:: sql

        SELECT CAST(unit_price AS NUMERIC(10, 4)) FROM product

    The :func:`.cast` function performs two distinct functions when
    used.  The first is that it renders the ``CAST`` expression within
    the resulting SQL string.  The second is that it associates the given
    type (e.g. :class:`.TypeEngine` class or instance) with the column
    expression on the Python side, which means the expression will take
    on the expression operator behavior associated with that type,
    as well as the bound-value handling and result-row-handling behavior
    of the type.

    An alternative to :func:`.cast` is the :func:`.type_coerce` function.
    This function performs the second task of associating an expression
    with a specific type, but does not render the ``CAST`` expression
    in SQL.

    a textual SQL string directly.

    E.g.::

        from sqlalchemy import text

        t = text("SELECT * FROM users")
        result = connection.execute(t)

    The advantages :func:`_expression.text`
    provides over a plain string are
    backend-neutral support for bind parameters, per-statement
    execution options, as well as
    bind parameter and result-column typing behavior, allowing
    SQLAlchemy type constructs to play a role when executing
    a statement that is specified literally.  The construct can also
    be provided with a ``.c`` collection of column elements, allowing
    it to be embedded in other SQL expression constructs as a subquery.

    Bind parameters are specified by name, using the format ``:name``.
    E.g.::

        t = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=:user_id")
        result = connection.execute(t, {"user_id": 12})

    For SQL statements where a colon is required verbatim, as within
    an inline string, use a backslash to escape::

        t = text(r"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='\:username'")

    The :class:`_expression.TextClause`
    construct includes methods which can
    provide information about the bound parameters as well as the column
    values which would be returned from the textual statement, assuming
    it's an executable SELECT type of statement.  The
    :meth:`_expression.TextClause.bindparams`
    method is used to provide bound
    parameter detail, and :meth:`_expression.TextClause.columns`
    method allows
    specification of return columns including names and types::

        t = (
            text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=:user_id")
            .bindparams(user_id=7)
            .columns(id=Integer, name=String)
        )

        for id, name in connection.execute(t):
            print(id, name)

    The :func:`_expression.text` construct is used in cases when
    a literal string SQL fragment is specified as part of a larger query,
    such as for the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement::

        s = select(users.c.id, users.c.name).where(text("id=:user_id"))
        result = connection.execute(s, {"user_id": 12})

    :func:`_expression.text` is also used for the construction
    of a full, standalone statement using plain text.
    As such, SQLAlchemy refers
    to it as an :class:`.Executable` object and may be used
    like any other statement passed to an ``.execute()`` method.

    :param text:
      the text of the SQL statement to be created.  Use ``:<param>``
      to specify bind parameters; they will be compiled to their

    .. note:: the :func:`.type_coerce` construct does not render any
       SQL syntax of its own, including that it does not imply
       parenthesization.   Please use :meth:`.TypeCoerce.self_group`
       if explicit parenthesization is required.

            type_coerce(log_table.date_string, StringDateTime()).label("date")

    A type that features bound-value handling will also have that behavior
    take effect when literal values or :func:`.bindparam` constructs are
    passed to :func:`.type_coerce` as targets.
    For example, if a type implements the
    :meth:`.TypeEngine.bind_expression`
    method or :meth:`.TypeEngine.bind_processor` method or equivalent,
    these functions will take effect at statement compilation/execution
    time when a literal value is passed, as in::

        # bound-value handling of MyStringType will be applied to the
        # literal value "some string"
        stmt = select(type_coerce("some string", MyStringType))

    **parenthesis are not applied**.   If :func:`.type_coerce` is being
    used in an operator context where the parenthesis normally present from
