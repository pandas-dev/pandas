"""SQL connections, SQL execution and high-level DB-API interface.

The engine package defines the basic components used to interface
DB-API modules with higher-level statement construction,
connection-management, execution and result contexts.  The primary
"entry point" class into this package is the Engine and its public
constructor ``create_engine()``.
