                self.log.info("Plugin logged cursor event: %s", statement)

    Plugins are registered using entry points in a similar way as that
    of dialects::

        entry_points = {
            "sqlalchemy.plugins": [
                "log_cursor_plugin = myapp.plugins:LogCursorEventsPlugin"
            ]
        }

    A plugin that uses the above names would be invoked from a database
    URL as in::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine(
            "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test?"
            "plugin=log_cursor_plugin&log_cursor_logging_name=mylogger"
        )

    The ``plugin`` URL parameter supports multiple instances, so that a URL
    may specify multiple plugins; they are loaded in the order stated
    in the URL::

        engine = create_engine(
            "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test?"
            "plugin=plugin_one&plugin=plugin_twp&plugin=plugin_three"
        )

    The plugin names may also be passed directly to :func:`_sa.create_engine`
    using the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.plugins` argument::

        engine = create_engine(
            "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test", plugins=["myplugin"]
        )

    .. versionadded:: 1.2.3  plugin names can also be specified
       to :func:`_sa.create_engine` as a list

    A plugin may consume plugin-specific arguments from the
    :class:`_engine.URL` object as well as the ``kwargs`` dictionary, which is
    the dictionary of arguments passed to the :func:`_sa.create_engine`
    call.  "Consuming" these arguments includes that they must be removed
    when the plugin initializes, so that the arguments are not passed along
    to the :class:`_engine.Dialect` constructor, where they will raise an
    :class:`_exc.ArgumentError` because they are not known by the dialect.

    As of version 1.4 of SQLAlchemy, arguments should continue to be consumed
    from the ``kwargs`` dictionary directly, by removing the values with a
    method such as ``dict.pop``. Arguments from the :class:`_engine.URL` object
    should be consumed by implementing the
    :meth:`_engine.CreateEnginePlugin.update_url` method, returning a new copy
    of the :class:`_engine.URL` with plugin-specific parameters removed::

        class MyPlugin(CreateEnginePlugin):
            def __init__(self, url, kwargs):
                self.my_argument_one = url.query["my_argument_one"]
                self.my_argument_two = url.query["my_argument_two"]
                self.my_argument_three = kwargs.pop("my_argument_three", None)

            def update_url(self, url):
                return url.difference_update_query(
                    ["my_argument_one", "my_argument_two"]
                )

    Arguments like those illustrated above would be consumed from a
    :func:`_sa.create_engine` call such as::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine(
            "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test?"
            "plugin=myplugin&my_argument_one=foo&my_argument_two=bar",
            my_argument_three="bat",
        )

    .. versionchanged:: 1.4

        The :class:`_engine.URL` object is now immutable; a
        :class:`_engine.CreateEnginePlugin` that needs to alter the
        :class:`_engine.URL` should implement the newly added
        :meth:`_engine.CreateEnginePlugin.update_url` method, which
        is invoked after the plugin is constructed.

        For migration, construct the plugin in the following way, checking
        for the existence of the :meth:`_engine.CreateEnginePlugin.update_url`
        method to detect which version is running::

            class MyPlugin(CreateEnginePlugin):
                def __init__(self, url, kwargs):
                    if hasattr(CreateEnginePlugin, "update_url"):
                        # detect the 1.4 API
                        self.my_argument_one = url.query["my_argument_one"]
                        self.my_argument_two = url.query["my_argument_two"]
                    else:
                        # detect the 1.3 and earlier API - mutate the
                        # URL directly
                        self.my_argument_one = url.query.pop("my_argument_one")
                        self.my_argument_two = url.query.pop("my_argument_two")

                    self.my_argument_three = kwargs.pop("my_argument_three", None)

                def update_url(self, url):
                    # this method is only called in the 1.4 version
                    return url.difference_update_query(
                        ["my_argument_one", "my_argument_two"]

    When the engine creation process completes and produces the
    :class:`_engine.Engine` object, it is again passed to the plugin via the
    :meth:`_engine.CreateEnginePlugin.engine_created` hook.  In this hook, additional

    when a "disconnect" condition is in effect.

    Setting this flag to False within the scope of the
    :meth:`_events.DialectEvents.handle_error`
    event will have the effect such
    that the full collection of connections in the pool will not be
    invalidated during a disconnect; only the current connection that is the
    subject of the error will actually be invalidated.

    The purpose of this flag is for custom disconnect-handling schemes where
    the invalidation of other connections in the pool is to be performed
    based on other conditions, or even on a per-connection basis.
