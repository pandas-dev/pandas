class ConnectionEvents(event.Events[ConnectionEventsTarget]):
    """Available events for
    :class:`_engine.Connection` and :class:`_engine.Engine`.

    The methods here define the name of an event as well as the names of
    members that are passed to listener functions.

    An event listener can be associated with any
    :class:`_engine.Connection` or :class:`_engine.Engine`
    class or instance, such as an :class:`_engine.Engine`, e.g.::

        from sqlalchemy import event, create_engine


        def before_cursor_execute(
            conn, cursor, statement, parameters, context, executemany
        ):
            log.info("Received statement: %s", statement)


        engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/test")
        event.listen(engine, "before_cursor_execute", before_cursor_execute)

    or with a specific :class:`_engine.Connection`::

        with engine.begin() as conn:

            @event.listens_for(conn, "before_cursor_execute")
            def before_cursor_execute(
                conn, cursor, statement, parameters, context, executemany
            ):
                log.info("Received statement: %s", statement)

    When the methods are called with a `statement` parameter, such as in
    :meth:`.after_cursor_execute` or :meth:`.before_cursor_execute`,
    the statement is the exact SQL string that was prepared for transmission
    to the DBAPI ``cursor`` in the connection's :class:`.Dialect`.

    The :meth:`.before_execute` and :meth:`.before_cursor_execute`
    events can also be established with the ``retval=True`` flag, which
    allows modification of the statement and parameters to be sent
    to the database.  The :meth:`.before_cursor_execute` event is
    particularly useful here to add ad-hoc string transformations, such
    as comments, to all executions::

        from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine
        from sqlalchemy import event


        @event.listens_for(Engine, "before_cursor_execute", retval=True)
        def comment_sql_calls(
            conn, cursor, statement, parameters, context, executemany
        ):
            statement = statement + " -- some comment"
            return statement, parameters

    .. note:: :class:`_events.ConnectionEvents` can be established on any
       combination of :class:`_engine.Engine`, :class:`_engine.Connection`,
       as well
       as instances of each of those classes.  Events across all
       four scopes will fire off for a given instance of
       :class:`_engine.Connection`.  However, for performance reasons, the
       :class:`_engine.Connection` object determines at instantiation time
       whether or not its parent :class:`_engine.Engine` has event listeners
       established.   Event listeners added to the :class:`_engine.Engine`
       class or to an instance of :class:`_engine.Engine`
       *after* the instantiation
       of a dependent :class:`_engine.Connection` instance will usually
       *not* be available on that :class:`_engine.Connection` instance.
       The newly
       added listeners will instead take effect for
       :class:`_engine.Connection`
       instances created subsequent to those event listeners being
       established on the parent :class:`_engine.Engine` class or instance.

    :param retval=False: Applies to the :meth:`.before_execute` and
      :meth:`.before_cursor_execute` events only.  When True, the
      user-defined event function must have a return value, which
      is a tuple of parameters that replace the given statement
      and parameters.  See those methods for a description of
      specific return arguments.

        emitted within the scope of a :class:`_engine.Connection`.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0 the :meth:`.DialectEvents.handle_error` event
           is moved to the :class:`.DialectEvents` class, moved from the
           :class:`.ConnectionEvents` class, so that it may also participate in
           the "pre ping" operation configured with the
           :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_pre_ping` parameter. The event
           remains registered by using the :class:`_engine.Engine` as the event
           target, however note that using the :class:`_engine.Connection` as
           an event target for :meth:`.DialectEvents.handle_error` is no longer
           supported.

        This includes all exceptions emitted by the DBAPI as well as
        within SQLAlchemy's statement invocation process, including
        encoding errors and other statement validation errors.  Other areas
        in which the event is invoked include transaction begin and end,
        result row fetching, cursor creation.

        Note that :meth:`.handle_error` may support new kinds of exceptions
        and new calling scenarios at *any time*.  Code which uses this
        event must expect new calling patterns to be present in minor
        releases.

        To support the wide variety of members that correspond to an exception,
        as well as to allow extensibility of the event without backwards
        incompatibility, the sole argument received is an instance of
        :class:`.ExceptionContext`.   This object contains data members
        representing detail about the exception.

        Use cases supported by this hook include:

        * read-only, low-level exception handling for logging and
          debugging purposes
        * Establishing whether a DBAPI connection error message indicates
          that the database connection needs to be reconnected, including
          for the "pre_ping" handler used by **some** dialects
        * Establishing or disabling whether a connection or the owning
          connection pool is invalidated or expired in response to a
          specific exception
        * exception re-writing

        The hook is called while the cursor from the failed operation
        (if any) is still open and accessible.   Special cleanup operations
        can be called on this cursor; SQLAlchemy will attempt to close
        this cursor subsequent to this hook being invoked.

        As of SQLAlchemy 2.0, the "pre_ping" handler enabled using the
        :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_pre_ping` parameter will also
        participate in the :meth:`.handle_error` process, **for those dialects
        that rely upon disconnect codes to detect database liveness**. Note
        that some dialects such as psycopg, psycopg2, and most MySQL dialects
        make use of a native ``ping()`` method supplied by the DBAPI which does
        not make use of disconnect codes.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0.0 The :meth:`.DialectEvents.handle_error`
           event hook participates in connection pool "pre-ping" operations.
           Within this usage, the :attr:`.ExceptionContext.engine` attribute
           will be ``None``, however the :class:`.Dialect` in use is always
           available via the :attr:`.ExceptionContext.dialect` attribute.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0.5 Added :attr:`.ExceptionContext.is_pre_ping`
           attribute which will be set to ``True`` when the
           :meth:`.DialectEvents.handle_error` event hook is triggered within
           a connection pool pre-ping operation.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0.5 An issue was repaired that allows for the
           PostgreSQL ``psycopg`` and ``psycopg2`` drivers, as well as all
           MySQL drivers, to properly participate in the
           :meth:`.DialectEvents.handle_error` event hook during
           connection pool "pre-ping" operations; previously, the
           implementation was non-working for these drivers.


        A handler function has two options for replacing
        the SQLAlchemy-constructed exception into one that is user
        defined.   It can either raise this new exception directly, in
        which case all further event listeners are bypassed and the
        exception will be raised, after appropriate cleanup as taken
        place::

            @event.listens_for(Engine, "handle_error")
            def handle_exception(context):
                if isinstance(
                    context.original_exception, psycopg2.OperationalError
                ) and "failed" in str(context.original_exception):
                    raise MySpecialException("failed operation")

        .. warning::  Because the
           :meth:`_events.DialectEvents.handle_error`
           event specifically provides for exceptions to be re-thrown as
           the ultimate exception raised by the failed statement,
           **stack traces will be misleading** if the user-defined event
           handler itself fails and throws an unexpected exception;
           the stack trace may not illustrate the actual code line that
           failed!  It is advised to code carefully here and use
           logging and/or inline debugging if unexpected exceptions are
           occurring.

        Alternatively, a "chained" style of event handling can be
        used, by configuring the handler with the ``retval=True``
        modifier and returning the new exception instance from the
        function.  In this case, event handling will continue onto the
        next handler.   The "chained" exception is available using
        :attr:`.ExceptionContext.chained_exception`::

            @event.listens_for(Engine, "handle_error", retval=True)
            def handle_exception(context):
                if (
                    context.chained_exception is not None
                    and "special" in context.chained_exception.message
                ):
                    return MySpecialException(
                        "failed", cause=context.chained_exception
                    )

        Handlers that return ``None`` may be used within the chain; when
        a handler returns ``None``, the previous exception instance,
        if any, is maintained as the current exception that is passed onto the
        next handler.

        When a custom exception is raised or returned, SQLAlchemy raises
        this new exception as-is, it is not wrapped by any SQLAlchemy
        object.  If the exception is not a subclass of
        :class:`sqlalchemy.exc.StatementError`,
        certain features may not be available; currently this includes
        the ORM's feature of adding a detail hint about "autoflush" to
        exceptions raised within the autoflush process.

        :param context: an :class:`.ExceptionContext` object.  See this
         class for details on all available members.

        This event is emitted in the case where the dialect makes use of the
