        :param bind: An optional :class:`_engine.Engine` or
           :class:`_engine.Connection` to
           which this ``Session`` should be bound. When specified, all SQL
           operations performed by this session will execute via this
           connectable.

        :param binds: A dictionary which may specify any number of
           :class:`_engine.Engine` or :class:`_engine.Connection`
           objects as the source of
           connectivity for SQL operations on a per-entity basis.   The keys
           of the dictionary consist of any series of mapped classes,
           arbitrary Python classes that are bases for mapped classes,
           :class:`_schema.Table` objects and :class:`_orm.Mapper` objects.
           The
           values of the dictionary are then instances of
           :class:`_engine.Engine`
           or less commonly :class:`_engine.Connection` objects.
           Operations which
           proceed relative to a particular mapped class will consult this
           dictionary for the closest matching entity in order to determine
           which :class:`_engine.Engine` should be used for a particular SQL
           operation.    The complete heuristics for resolution are
           described at :meth:`.Session.get_bind`.  Usage looks like::

            Session = sessionmaker(
                binds={
                    SomeMappedClass: create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://engine1"),

        :param \class_: Specify an alternate class other than

        :param enable_baked_queries: legacy; defaults to ``True``.
           A parameter consumed
           by the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.baked` extension to determine if
           "baked queries" should be cached, as is the normal operation
           of this extension.  When set to ``False``, caching as used by
           this particular extension is disabled.

           .. versionchanged:: 1.4 The ``sqlalchemy.ext.baked`` extension is
              legacy and is not used by any of SQLAlchemy's internals. This
              flag therefore only affects applications that are making explicit
              use of this extension within their own code.

        :param expire_on_commit:  Defaults to ``True``. When ``True``, all
           instances will be fully expired after each :meth:`~.commit`,
           so that all attribute/object access subsequent to a completed

           :class:`.Session`.

        :param query_cls:  Class which should be used to create new Query
          objects, as returned by the :meth:`~.Session.query` method.
          Defaults to :class:`_query.Query`.

        :param twophase:  When ``True``, all transactions will be started as
            a "two phase" transaction, i.e. using the "two phase" semantics
            of the database in use along with an XID.  During a
            :meth:`~.commit`, after :meth:`~.flush` has been issued for all
            attached databases, the :meth:`~.TwoPhaseTransaction.prepare`
            method on each database's :class:`.TwoPhaseTransaction` will be
            called. This allows each database to roll back the entire
            transaction, before each transaction is committed.

        :param autocommit: the "autocommit" keyword is present for backwards
            compatibility but must remain at its default value of ``False``.

        :param join_transaction_mode: Describes the transactional behavior to
          take when a given bind is a :class:`_engine.Connection` that
          has already begun a transaction outside the scope of this
          :class:`_orm.Session`; in other words the
          :meth:`_engine.Connection.in_transaction()` method returns True.

          The following behaviors only take effect when the :class:`_orm.Session`
          **actually makes use of the connection given**; that is, a method
          such as :meth:`_orm.Session.execute`, :meth:`_orm.Session.connection`,
          etc. are actually invoked:

          * ``"conditional_savepoint"`` - this is the default.  if the given
            :class:`_engine.Connection` is begun within a transaction but
            does not have a SAVEPOINT, then ``"rollback_only"`` is used.
            If the :class:`_engine.Connection` is additionally within
            a SAVEPOINT, in other words
            :meth:`_engine.Connection.in_nested_transaction()` method returns
            True, then ``"create_savepoint"`` is used.

            ``"conditional_savepoint"`` behavior attempts to make use of
            savepoints in order to keep the state of the existing transaction
            unchanged, but only if there is already a savepoint in progress;
            otherwise, it is not assumed that the backend in use has adequate
            support for SAVEPOINT, as availability of this feature varies.
            ``"conditional_savepoint"`` also seeks to establish approximate
            backwards compatibility with previous :class:`_orm.Session`
            behavior, for applications that are not setting a specific mode. It
            is recommended that one of the explicit settings be used.

          * ``"create_savepoint"`` - the :class:`_orm.Session` will use
            :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin_nested()` in all cases to create
            its own transaction.  This transaction by its nature rides
            "on top" of any existing transaction that's opened on the given
            :class:`_engine.Connection`; if the underlying database and
            the driver in use has full, non-broken support for SAVEPOINT, the
            external transaction will remain unaffected throughout the
            lifespan of the :class:`_orm.Session`.

            The ``"create_savepoint"`` mode is the most useful for integrating
            a :class:`_orm.Session` into a test suite where an externally
            initiated transaction should remain unaffected; however, it relies
            on proper SAVEPOINT support from the underlying driver and
            database.

            .. tip:: When using SQLite, the SQLite driver included through
               Python 3.11 does not handle SAVEPOINTs correctly in all cases
               without workarounds. See the sections
               :ref:`pysqlite_serializable` and :ref:`aiosqlite_serializable`
               for details on current workarounds.

          * ``"control_fully"`` - the :class:`_orm.Session` will take
            control of the given transaction as its own;
            :meth:`_orm.Session.commit` will call ``.commit()`` on the
            transaction, :meth:`_orm.Session.rollback` will call
            ``.rollback()`` on the transaction, :meth:`_orm.Session.close` will
            call ``.rollback`` on the transaction.

            .. tip:: This mode of use is equivalent to how SQLAlchemy 1.4 would
               handle a :class:`_engine.Connection` given with an existing
               SAVEPOINT (i.e. :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin_nested`); the
               :class:`_orm.Session` would take full control of the existing
               SAVEPOINT.

          * ``"rollback_only"`` - the :class:`_orm.Session` will take control
            of the given transaction for ``.rollback()`` calls only;
            ``.commit()`` calls will not be propagated to the given
            transaction.  ``.close()`` calls will have no effect on the
            given transaction.

            .. tip:: This mode of use is equivalent to how SQLAlchemy 1.4 would
               handle a :class:`_engine.Connection` given with an existing
               regular database transaction (i.e.
               :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin`); the :class:`_orm.Session`
               would propagate :meth:`_orm.Session.rollback` calls to the
               underlying transaction, but not :meth:`_orm.Session.commit` or
               :meth:`_orm.Session.close` calls.

          .. versionadded:: 2.0.0rc1

        :param close_resets_only: Defaults to ``True``. Determines if
          the session should reset itself after calling ``.close()``
          or should pass in a no longer usable state, disabling re-use.

          .. versionadded:: 2.0.22 added flag ``close_resets_only``.

        explicitly bound directly to a :class:`_engine.Connection`.

        For a multiply-bound or unbound :class:`.Session`, the
        ``mapper`` or ``clause`` arguments are used to determine the
        appropriate bind to return.

        Note that the "mapper" argument is usually present
        when :meth:`.Session.get_bind` is called via an ORM
        operation such as a :meth:`.Session.query`, each
        individual INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operation within a
        :meth:`.Session.flush`, call, etc.

        The order of resolution is:

        1. if mapper given and :paramref:`.Session.binds` is present,
           locate a bind based first on the mapper in use, then
           on the mapped class in use, then on any base classes that are
           present in the ``__mro__`` of the mapped class, from more specific
           superclasses to more general.
        2. if clause given and ``Session.binds`` is present,
           locate a bind based on :class:`_schema.Table` objects
           found in the given clause present in ``Session.binds``.
        3. if ``Session.binds`` is present, return that.
        4. if clause given, attempt to return a bind
           linked to the :class:`_schema.MetaData` ultimately
           associated with the clause.
        5. if mapper given, attempt to return a bind
           linked to the :class:`_schema.MetaData` ultimately
           associated with the :class:`_schema.Table` or other
           selectable to which the mapper is mapped.
        6. No bind can be found, :exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.UnboundExecutionError`
           is raised.

        Note that the :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method can be overridden on
        a user-defined subclass of :class:`.Session` to provide any kind
        of bind resolution scheme.  See the example at
        :ref:`session_custom_partitioning`.

        :param mapper:
          Optional mapped class or corresponding :class:`_orm.Mapper` instance.
          The bind can be derived from a :class:`_orm.Mapper` first by
          consulting the "binds" map associated with this :class:`.Session`,
          and secondly by consulting the :class:`_schema.MetaData` associated
          with the :class:`_schema.Table` to which the :class:`_orm.Mapper` is
          mapped for a bind.

        :param clause:
            A :class:`_expression.ClauseElement` (i.e.
            :func:`_expression.select`,
            :func:`_expression.text`,
            etc.).  If the ``mapper`` argument is not present or could not
            produce a bind, the given expression construct will be searched
            for a bound element, typically a :class:`_schema.Table`

            bound :class:`_schema.MetaData`.

        E.g.::

            some_object = session.get(VersionedFoo, (5, 10))

            some_object = session.get(VersionedFoo, {"id": 5, "version_id": 10})

        .. versionadded:: 1.4 Added :meth:`_orm.Session.get`, which is moved
           from the now legacy :meth:`_orm.Query.get` method.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` is special in that it provides direct
        access to the identity map of the :class:`.Session`.
        If the given primary key identifier is present
        in the local identity map, the object is returned
        directly from this collection and no SQL is emitted,
        unless the object has been marked fully expired.
        If not present,
        a SELECT is performed in order to locate the object.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` also will perform a check if
        the object is present in the identity map and
        marked as expired - a SELECT
        is emitted to refresh the object as well as to
        ensure that the row is still present.
        If not, :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.exc.ObjectDeletedError` is raised.

        :param entity: a mapped class or :class:`.Mapper` indicating the
         type of entity to be loaded.

        :param ident: A scalar, tuple, or dictionary representing the
         primary key.  For a composite (e.g. multiple column) primary key,
         a tuple or dictionary should be passed.

         For a single-column primary key, the scalar calling form is typically
         the most expedient.  If the primary key of a row is the value "5",
         the call looks like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, 5)

         The tuple form contains primary key values typically in
         the order in which they correspond to the mapped
         :class:`_schema.Table`
         object's primary key columns, or if the
         :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` configuration parameter were
         used, in
         the order used for that parameter. For example, if the primary key
         of a row is represented by the integer
         digits "5, 10" the call would look like::

             my_object = session.get(SomeClass, (5, 10))

         The dictionary form should include as keys the mapped attribute names
         corresponding to each element of the primary key.  If the mapped class
         has the attributes ``id``, ``version_id`` as the attributes which
         store the object's primary key value, the call would look like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, {"id": 5, "version_id": 10})

        :param options: optional sequence of loader options which will be
         applied to the query, if one is emitted.

        :param populate_existing: causes the method to unconditionally emit
         a SQL query and refresh the object with the newly loaded data,
         regardless of whether or not the object is already present.

        :param with_for_update: optional boolean ``True`` indicating FOR UPDATE
          should be used, or may be a dictionary containing flags to
          indicate a more specific set of FOR UPDATE flags for the SELECT;
          flags should match the parameters of
          :meth:`_query.Query.with_for_update`.
          Supersedes the :paramref:`.Session.refresh.lockmode` parameter.

        :param execution_options: optional dictionary of execution options,
         which will be associated with the query execution if one is emitted.
         This dictionary can provide a subset of the options that are
         accepted by :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`, and may
         also provide additional options understood only in an ORM context.

         the bind.  May include "mapper", "bind", or other custom arguments.

        :meth:`.Session.merge` examines the primary key attributes of the
        source instance, and attempts to reconcile it with an instance of the
        same primary key in the session.   If not found locally, it attempts
        to load the object from the database based on primary key, and if
        none can be located, creates a new instance.  The state of each
        attribute on the source instance is then copied to the target
        instance.  The resulting target instance is then returned by the
        method; the original source instance is left unmodified, and
        un-associated with the :class:`.Session` if not already.

        This operation cascades to associated instances if the association is
        mapped with ``cascade="merge"``.

        See :ref:`unitofwork_merging` for a detailed discussion of merging.

        :param instance: Instance to be merged.
        :param load: Boolean, when False, :meth:`.merge` switches into
         a "high performance" mode which causes it to forego emitting history
         events as well as all database access.  This flag is used for
         cases such as transferring graphs of objects into a :class:`.Session`
         from a second level cache, or to transfer just-loaded objects
         into the :class:`.Session` owned by a worker thread or process
         without re-querying the database.

         The ``load=False`` use case adds the caveat that the given
         object has to be in a "clean" state, that is, has no pending changes
         to be flushed - even if the incoming object is detached from any
         :class:`.Session`.   This is so that when
         the merge operation populates local attributes and
         cascades to related objects and
         collections, the values can be "stamped" onto the
         target object as is, without generating any history or attribute
         events, and without the need to reconcile the incoming data with
         any existing related objects or collections that might not
         be loaded.  The resulting objects from ``load=False`` are always
         produced as "clean", so it is only appropriate that the given objects
         should be "clean" as well, else this suggests a mis-use of the
         method.

        .. warning::

            :meth:`.enable_relationship_loading` exists to serve special
            use cases and is not recommended for general use.

        Accesses of attributes mapped with :func:`_orm.relationship`
        will attempt to load a value from the database using this
        :class:`.Session` as the source of connectivity.  The values
        will be loaded based on foreign key and primary key values
        present on this object - if not present, then those relationships
        will be unavailable.

        The object will be attached to this session, but will
        **not** participate in any persistence operations; its state
        for almost all purposes will remain either "transient" or
        "detached", except for the case of relationship loading.

        Also note that backrefs will often not work as expected.
        Altering a relationship-bound attribute on the target object
        may not fire off a backref event, if the effective value
        is what was already loaded from a foreign-key-holding value.

        The :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` method is
        similar to the ``load_on_pending`` flag on :func:`_orm.relationship`.
        Unlike that flag, :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` allows
        an object to remain transient while still being able to load
        related items.

        To make a transient object associated with a :class:`.Session`
        via :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` pending, add
        it to the :class:`.Session` using :meth:`.Session.add` normally.
        If the object instead represents an existing identity in the database,
        it should be merged using :meth:`.Session.merge`.

        :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` does not improve
        behavior when the ORM is used normally - object references should be
        constructed at the object level, not at the foreign key level, so
        that they are present in an ordinary way before flush()
        proceeds.  This method is not intended for general use.

        .. seealso::

            :paramref:`_orm.relationship.load_on_pending` - this flag
            allows per-relationship loading of many-to-ones on items that
            are pending.

            :func:`.make_transient_to_detached` - allows for an object to
            be added to a :class:`.Session` without SQL emitted, which then
            will unexpire attributes on access.

        .. legacy::

            This method is a legacy feature as of the 2.0 series of
            SQLAlchemy.   For modern bulk INSERT and UPDATE, see
            the sections :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_insert` and
            :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_update`.

            For general INSERT and UPDATE of existing ORM mapped objects,
            prefer standard :term:`unit of work` data management patterns,
            introduced in the :ref:`unified_tutorial` at
            :ref:`tutorial_orm_data_manipulation`.  SQLAlchemy 2.0
            now uses :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues` with modern dialects
            which solves previous issues of bulk INSERT slowness.

        :param objects: a sequence of mapped object instances.  The mapped
         objects are persisted as is, and are **not** associated with the
         :class:`.Session` afterwards.

         For each object, whether the object is sent as an INSERT or an
         UPDATE is dependent on the same rules used by the :class:`.Session`
         in traditional operation; if the object has the
         :attr:`.InstanceState.key`
         attribute set, then the object is assumed to be "detached" and
         will result in an UPDATE.  Otherwise, an INSERT is used.

         In the case of an UPDATE, statements are grouped based on which
         attributes have changed, and are thus to be the subject of each
         SET clause.  If ``update_changed_only`` is False, then all
         attributes present within each object are applied to the UPDATE
         statement, which may help in allowing the statements to be grouped
         together into a larger executemany(), and will also reduce the
         overhead of checking history on attributes.

        :param return_defaults: when True, rows that are missing values which
         generate defaults, namely integer primary key defaults and sequences,
         will be inserted **one at a time**, so that the primary key value
         is available.  In particular this will allow joined-inheritance
         and other multi-table mappings to insert correctly without the need
         to provide primary key values ahead of time; however,
         :paramref:`.Session.bulk_save_objects.return_defaults` **greatly
         reduces the performance gains** of the method overall.  It is strongly
         advised to please use the standard :meth:`_orm.Session.add_all`
         approach.

        :param update_changed_only: when True, UPDATE statements are rendered
         based on those attributes in each state that have logged changes.
         When False, all attributes present are rendered into the SET clause
         with the exception of primary key attributes.

        :param preserve_order: when True, the order of inserts and updates
         matches exactly the order in which the objects are given.   When
         False, common types of objects are grouped into inserts
         and updates, to allow for more batching opportunities.

        :param mappings: a sequence of dictionaries, each one containing the
         state of the mapped row to be inserted, in terms of the attribute
         names on the mapped class.   If the mapping refers to multiple tables,
         such as a joined-inheritance mapping, each dictionary must contain all
         keys to be populated into all tables.

        :param return_defaults: when True, the INSERT process will be altered
         to ensure that newly generated primary key values will be fetched.
         The rationale for this parameter is typically to enable
         :ref:`Joined Table Inheritance <joined_inheritance>` mappings to
         be bulk inserted.

         .. note:: for backends that don't support RETURNING, the
            :paramref:`_orm.Session.bulk_insert_mappings.return_defaults`
            parameter can significantly decrease performance as INSERT
            statements can no longer be batched.   See
            :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues`
            for background on which backends are affected.

        :param render_nulls: When True, a value of ``None`` will result
         in a NULL value being included in the INSERT statement, rather
         than the column being omitted from the INSERT.   This allows all
         the rows being INSERTed to have the identical set of columns which
         allows the full set of rows to be batched to the DBAPI.  Normally,
         each column-set that contains a different combination of NULL values
         than the previous row must omit a different series of columns from
         the rendered INSERT statement, which means it must be emitted as a
         separate statement.   By passing this flag, the full set of rows
         are guaranteed to be batchable into one batch; the cost however is
         that server-side defaults which are invoked by an omitted column will
         be skipped, so care must be taken to ensure that these are not
         necessary.

         .. warning::

            When this flag is set, **server side default SQL values will
            not be invoked** for those columns that are inserted as NULL;
            the NULL value will be sent explicitly.   Care must be taken
            to ensure that no server-side default functions need to be
            invoked for the operation as a whole.

        This method retrieves the history for each instrumented
        attribute on the instance and performs a comparison of the current
        value to its previously flushed or committed value, if any.

        It is in effect a more expensive and accurate
        version of checking for the given instance in the
        :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection; a full test for
        each attribute's net "dirty" status is performed.

        E.g.::

            return session.is_modified(someobject)

        A few caveats to this method apply:

        * Instances present in the :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection may
          report ``False`` when tested with this method.  This is because
          the object may have received change events via attribute mutation,
          thus placing it in :attr:`.Session.dirty`, but ultimately the state
          is the same as that loaded from the database, resulting in no net
          change here.
        * Scalar attributes may not have recorded the previously set
          value when a new value was applied, if the attribute was not loaded,
          or was expired, at the time the new value was received - in these
          cases, the attribute is assumed to have a change, even if there is
          ultimately no net change against its database value. SQLAlchemy in
          most cases does not need the "old" value when a set event occurs, so
          it skips the expense of a SQL call if the old value isn't present,
          based on the assumption that an UPDATE of the scalar value is
          usually needed, and in those few cases where it isn't, is less
          expensive on average than issuing a defensive SELECT.

          The "old" value is fetched unconditionally upon set only if the
          attribute container has the ``active_history`` flag set to ``True``.
          This flag is set typically for primary key attributes and scalar
          object references that are not a simple many-to-one.  To set this
          flag for any arbitrary mapped column, use the ``active_history``
          argument with :func:`.column_property`.

        :param instance: mapped instance to be tested for pending changes.
        :param include_collections: Indicates if multivalued collections
         should be included in the operation.  Setting this to ``False`` is a
         way to detect only local-column based properties (i.e. scalar columns
         or many-to-one foreign keys) that would result in an UPDATE for this
         instance upon flush.

    """A configurable :class:`.Session` factory.

    The :class:`.sessionmaker` factory generates new
    :class:`.Session` objects when called, creating them given
    the configurational arguments established here.

    e.g.::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

        # an Engine, which the Session will use for connection
        # resources
        engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/")

            session.add(some_object)
            session.add(some_other_object)
            session.commit()

    Context manager use is optional; otherwise, the returned
    :class:`_orm.Session` object may be closed explicitly via the
    :meth:`_orm.Session.close` method.   Using a
    ``try:/finally:`` block is optional, however will ensure that the close
    takes place even if there are database errors::

        session = Session()
        try:
            session.add(some_object)
            session.add(some_other_object)
            session.commit()
        finally:
            session.close()

    :class:`.sessionmaker` acts as a factory for :class:`_orm.Session`
    objects in the same way as an :class:`_engine.Engine` acts as a factory
    for :class:`_engine.Connection` objects.  In this way it also includes
    a :meth:`_orm.sessionmaker.begin` method, that provides a context
    manager which both begins and commits a transaction, as well as closes
    out the :class:`_orm.Session` when complete, rolling back the transaction
    if any errors occur::

        Session = sessionmaker(engine)

        with Session.begin() as session:
            session.add(some_object)
            session.add(some_other_object)
        # commits transaction, closes session

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    When calling upon :class:`_orm.sessionmaker` to construct a
    :class:`_orm.Session`, keyword arguments may also be passed to the
    method; these arguments will override that of the globally configured
    parameters.  Below we use a :class:`_orm.sessionmaker` bound to a certain
    :class:`_engine.Engine` to produce a :class:`_orm.Session` that is instead
    bound to a specific :class:`_engine.Connection` procured from that engine::

        Session = sessionmaker(engine)

        # bind an individual session to a connection

        with engine.connect() as connection:
            with Session(bind=connection) as session:
                ...  # work with session

    The class also includes a method :meth:`_orm.sessionmaker.configure`, which
    can be used to specify additional keyword arguments to the factory, which
    will take effect for subsequent :class:`.Session` objects generated. This
    is usually used to associate one or more :class:`_engine.Engine` objects
    with an existing
    :class:`.sessionmaker` factory before it is first used::

        # application starts, sessionmaker does not have
        # an engine bound yet
        Session = sessionmaker()

        # ... later, when an engine URL is read from a configuration
        # file or other events allow the engine to be created

    The given mapped instance is assumed to be in the :term:`persistent` or
    :term:`detached` state.   The function will remove its association with any
    :class:`.Session` as well as its :attr:`.InstanceState.identity`. The
    effect is that the object will behave as though it were newly constructed,

    :meth:`.Session.delete`.

        :func:`.make_transient` does **not** "unexpire" or otherwise eagerly

        * were expired via :meth:`.Session.expire`

        * were expired as the natural effect of committing a session
          transaction, e.g. :meth:`.Session.commit`

        * are normally :term:`lazy loaded` but are not currently loaded

        * are "deferred" (see :ref:`orm_queryguide_column_deferral`) and are
          not yet loaded

        * were not present in the query which loaded this object, such as that
          which is common in joined table inheritance and other scenarios.

        After :func:`.make_transient` is called, unloaded attributes such
        as those above will normally resolve to the value ``None`` when
        accessed, or an empty collection for a collection-oriented attribute.
