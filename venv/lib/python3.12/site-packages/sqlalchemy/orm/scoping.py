        .. versionadded:: 1.4 Added :meth:`_orm.Session.get`, which is moved
           from the now legacy :meth:`_orm.Query.get` method.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` is special in that it provides direct
        access to the identity map of the :class:`.Session`.
        If the given primary key identifier is present
        in the local identity map, the object is returned
        directly from this collection and no SQL is emitted,
        unless the object has been marked fully expired.
        If not present,
        a SELECT is performed in order to locate the object.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` also will perform a check if
        the object is present in the identity map and
        marked as expired - a SELECT
        is emitted to refresh the object as well as to
        ensure that the row is still present.
        If not, :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.exc.ObjectDeletedError` is raised.

        :param entity: a mapped class or :class:`.Mapper` indicating the
         type of entity to be loaded.

        :param ident: A scalar, tuple, or dictionary representing the
         primary key.  For a composite (e.g. multiple column) primary key,
         a tuple or dictionary should be passed.

         For a single-column primary key, the scalar calling form is typically
         the most expedient.  If the primary key of a row is the value "5",
         the call looks like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, 5)

         The tuple form contains primary key values typically in
         the order in which they correspond to the mapped
         :class:`_schema.Table`
         object's primary key columns, or if the
         :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` configuration parameter were
         used, in
         the order used for that parameter. For example, if the primary key
         of a row is represented by the integer
         digits "5, 10" the call would look like::

             my_object = session.get(SomeClass, (5, 10))

         The dictionary form should include as keys the mapped attribute names
         corresponding to each element of the primary key.  If the mapped class
         has the attributes ``id``, ``version_id`` as the attributes which
         store the object's primary key value, the call would look like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, {"id": 5, "version_id": 10})

        :param options: optional sequence of loader options which will be

        :param populate_existing: causes the method to unconditionally emit
         a SQL query and refresh the object with the newly loaded data,
         regardless of whether or not the object is already present.

          should be used, or may be a dictionary containing flags to
          indicate a more specific set of FOR UPDATE flags for the SELECT;

          :meth:`_query.Query.with_for_update`.
          Supersedes the :paramref:`.Session.refresh.lockmode` parameter.

        Note that the :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method can be overridden on

        :param mapper:
          Optional mapped class or corresponding :class:`_orm.Mapper` instance.
          The bind can be derived from a :class:`_orm.Mapper` first by
          consulting the "binds" map associated with this :class:`.Session`,
          and secondly by consulting the :class:`_schema.MetaData` associated
          with the :class:`_schema.Table` to which the :class:`_orm.Mapper` is
          mapped for a bind.

        :param clause:

            etc.).  If the ``mapper`` argument is not present or could not
            produce a bind, the given expression construct will be searched
            for a bound element, typically a :class:`_schema.Table`

            bound :class:`_schema.MetaData`.

            behalf of the :class:`_orm.scoping.scoped_session` class.

        This method retrieves the history for each instrumented
        attribute on the instance and performs a comparison of the current
        value to its previously flushed or committed value, if any.

        It is in effect a more expensive and accurate
        version of checking for the given instance in the
        :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection; a full test for
        each attribute's net "dirty" status is performed.

        E.g.::

            return session.is_modified(someobject)

        A few caveats to this method apply:

        * Instances present in the :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection may
          report ``False`` when tested with this method.  This is because
          the object may have received change events via attribute mutation,
          thus placing it in :attr:`.Session.dirty`, but ultimately the state
          is the same as that loaded from the database, resulting in no net
          change here.
        * Scalar attributes may not have recorded the previously set
          value when a new value was applied, if the attribute was not loaded,
          or was expired, at the time the new value was received - in these
          cases, the attribute is assumed to have a change, even if there is
          ultimately no net change against its database value. SQLAlchemy in
          most cases does not need the "old" value when a set event occurs, so
          it skips the expense of a SQL call if the old value isn't present,
          based on the assumption that an UPDATE of the scalar value is
          usually needed, and in those few cases where it isn't, is less
          expensive on average than issuing a defensive SELECT.

          The "old" value is fetched unconditionally upon set only if the
          attribute container has the ``active_history`` flag set to ``True``.
          This flag is set typically for primary key attributes and scalar
          object references that are not a simple many-to-one.  To set this
          flag for any arbitrary mapped column, use the ``active_history``
          argument with :func:`.column_property`.

        :param instance: mapped instance to be tested for pending changes.
        :param include_collections: Indicates if multivalued collections
         should be included in the operation.  Setting this to ``False`` is a
         way to detect only local-column based properties (i.e. scalar columns
         or many-to-one foreign keys) that would result in an UPDATE for this
         instance upon flush.

            the sections :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_insert` and
            :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_update`.

            For general INSERT and UPDATE of existing ORM mapped objects,
            prefer standard :term:`unit of work` data management patterns,
            introduced in the :ref:`unified_tutorial` at
            :ref:`tutorial_orm_data_manipulation`.  SQLAlchemy 2.0
            now uses :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues` with modern dialects
            which solves previous issues of bulk INSERT slowness.

        :param objects: a sequence of mapped object instances.  The mapped
         objects are persisted as is, and are **not** associated with the
         :class:`.Session` afterwards.

         For each object, whether the object is sent as an INSERT or an
         UPDATE is dependent on the same rules used by the :class:`.Session`
         in traditional operation; if the object has the
         :attr:`.InstanceState.key`
         attribute set, then the object is assumed to be "detached" and
         will result in an UPDATE.  Otherwise, an INSERT is used.

         In the case of an UPDATE, statements are grouped based on which
         attributes have changed, and are thus to be the subject of each
         SET clause.  If ``update_changed_only`` is False, then all
         attributes present within each object are applied to the UPDATE
         statement, which may help in allowing the statements to be grouped
         together into a larger executemany(), and will also reduce the
         overhead of checking history on attributes.

        :param return_defaults: when True, rows that are missing values which
         generate defaults, namely integer primary key defaults and sequences,
         will be inserted **one at a time**, so that the primary key value
         is available.  In particular this will allow joined-inheritance
         and other multi-table mappings to insert correctly without the need
         to provide primary key values ahead of time; however,
         :paramref:`.Session.bulk_save_objects.return_defaults` **greatly
         reduces the performance gains** of the method overall.  It is strongly
         advised to please use the standard :meth:`_orm.Session.add_all`
         approach.

        :param update_changed_only: when True, UPDATE statements are rendered
         based on those attributes in each state that have logged changes.
         When False, all attributes present are rendered into the SET clause
         with the exception of primary key attributes.

        :param preserve_order: when True, the order of inserts and updates
         matches exactly the order in which the objects are given.   When
         False, common types of objects are grouped into inserts
         and updates, to allow for more batching opportunities.

         state of the mapped row to be inserted, in terms of the attribute
         names on the mapped class.   If the mapping refers to multiple tables,
         such as a joined-inheritance mapping, each dictionary must contain all
         keys to be populated into all tables.

        :param return_defaults: when True, the INSERT process will be altered
         to ensure that newly generated primary key values will be fetched.
         The rationale for this parameter is typically to enable
         :ref:`Joined Table Inheritance <joined_inheritance>` mappings to
         be bulk inserted.

         .. note:: for backends that don't support RETURNING, the
            :paramref:`_orm.Session.bulk_insert_mappings.return_defaults`
            parameter can significantly decrease performance as INSERT
            statements can no longer be batched.   See
            :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues`
            for background on which backends are affected.

        :param render_nulls: When True, a value of ``None`` will result
         in a NULL value being included in the INSERT statement, rather
         than the column being omitted from the INSERT.   This allows all
         the rows being INSERTed to have the identical set of columns which
         allows the full set of rows to be batched to the DBAPI.  Normally,
         each column-set that contains a different combination of NULL values
         than the previous row must omit a different series of columns from
         the rendered INSERT statement, which means it must be emitted as a
         separate statement.   By passing this flag, the full set of rows
         are guaranteed to be batchable into one batch; the cost however is
         that server-side defaults which are invoked by an omitted column will
         be skipped, so care must be taken to ensure that these are not
         necessary.

         .. warning::

            When this flag is set, **server side default SQL values will
            not be invoked** for those columns that are inserted as NULL;
            the NULL value will be sent explicitly.   Care must be taken
            to ensure that no server-side default functions need to be
            invoked for the operation as a whole.

        to load the object from the database based on primary key, and if
        none can be located, creates a new instance.  The state of each
        attribute on the source instance is then copied to the target
        instance.  The resulting target instance is then returned by the
        method; the original source instance is left unmodified, and
        un-associated with the :class:`.Session` if not already.

        This operation cascades to associated instances if the association is

        See :ref:`unitofwork_merging` for a detailed discussion of merging.

        :param instance: Instance to be merged.
        :param load: Boolean, when False, :meth:`.merge` switches into
         a "high performance" mode which causes it to forego emitting history

         into the :class:`.Session` owned by a worker thread or process
         without re-querying the database.

         The ``load=False`` use case adds the caveat that the given
         object has to be in a "clean" state, that is, has no pending changes
         to be flushed - even if the incoming object is detached from any
         :class:`.Session`.   This is so that when
         the merge operation populates local attributes and

         collections, the values can be "stamped" onto the
         target object as is, without generating any history or attribute
         events, and without the need to reconcile the incoming data with
         any existing related objects or collections that might not
         be loaded.  The resulting objects from ``load=False`` are always
         produced as "clean", so it is only appropriate that the given objects

        The selected attributes will first be expired as they would when using
        :meth:`_orm.Session.expire`; then a SELECT statement will be issued to
        the database to refresh column-oriented attributes with the current
        value available in the current transaction.

        :func:`_orm.relationship` oriented attributes will also be immediately
        loaded if they were already eagerly loaded on the object, using the
        same eager loading strategy that they were loaded with originally.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4 - the :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` method
           can also refresh eagerly loaded attributes.

        :func:`_orm.relationship` oriented attributes that would normally
        load using the ``select`` (or "lazy") loader strategy will also
        load **if they are named explicitly in the attribute_names
        collection**, emitting a SELECT statement for the attribute using the
        ``immediate`` loader strategy.  If lazy-loaded relationships are not
        named in :paramref:`_orm.Session.refresh.attribute_names`, then
        they remain as "lazy loaded" attributes and are not implicitly
        refreshed.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0.4  The :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` method
           will now refresh lazy-loaded :func:`_orm.relationship` oriented
           attributes for those which are named explicitly in the
           :paramref:`_orm.Session.refresh.attribute_names` collection.

        .. tip::

            While the :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` method is capable of
            refreshing both column and relationship oriented attributes, its
            primary focus is on refreshing of local column-oriented attributes
            on a single instance. For more open ended "refresh" functionality,
            including the ability to refresh the attributes on many objects at
            once while having explicit control over relationship loader
            strategies, use the
            :ref:`populate existing <orm_queryguide_populate_existing>` feature
            instead.

        Note that a highly isolated transaction will return the same values as
        were previously read in that same transaction, regardless of changes
        in database state outside of that transaction.   Refreshing
        attributes usually only makes sense at the start of a transaction
        where database rows have not yet been accessed.

        :param attribute_names: optional.  An iterable collection of
          string attribute names indicating a subset of attributes to
          be refreshed.

        :param with_for_update: optional boolean ``True`` indicating FOR UPDATE
          should be used, or may be a dictionary containing flags to
          indicate a more specific set of FOR UPDATE flags for the SELECT;
          flags should match the parameters of
          :meth:`_query.Query.with_for_update`.
