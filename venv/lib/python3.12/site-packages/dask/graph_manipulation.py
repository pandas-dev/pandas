    Make ``children`` collection(s), optionally omitting sub-collections, dependent on

    The first example creates an array ``b2`` whose computation first computes an array

    process:

    >>> import dask
    >>> import dask.array as da

    The second example creates arrays ``b3`` and ``c3``, whose computation first
    computes an array ``a`` and then computes the additions, this time not
    recomputing ``a`` in the process:

    parents
        Dask collection or nested structure of Dask collections
    omit
        Dask collection or nested structure of Dask collections
    seed
        Hashable used to seed the key regeneration. Omit to default to a random number
        that will produce different keys at every call.
    assume_layers
        True
            Use a fast algorithm that works at layer level, which assumes that all
            collections in ``children`` and ``omit``

            #. use :class:`~dask.highlevelgraph.HighLevelGraph`,
            #. define the ``__dask_layers__()`` method, and
            #. never had their graphs squashed and rebuilt between the creation of the
               ``omit`` collections and the ``children`` collections; in other words if
               the keys of the ``omit`` collections can be found among the keys of the
               ``children`` collections, then the same must also hold true for the
               layers.
        False
            Use a slower algorithm that works at keys level, which makes none of the
            above assumptions.

    Same as ``children``

        up to and excluding the nodes of ``omit``. Nodes immediately above ``omit``, or
        the leaf nodes if the collections in ``omit`` are not found, are prevented from
        computing until all collections in ``parents`` have been fully computed.
        The keys of the regenerated nodes will be different from the original ones, so

    >>> y = expensive_and_long_computation(x)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> z = wrap_up(clone(x), y)  # doctest: +SKIP

    In the above code, the chunks of x will be forgotten as soon as they are consumed by
    the chunks of y, and then they'll be regenerated from scratch at the very end of the
    computation. Without clone(), x would only be computed once and then kept in memory
    throughout the whole computation of y, needlessly consuming memory.
