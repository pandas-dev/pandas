# StrictYAML

StrictYAML is a [type-safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety) YAML parser
that parses and validates a [restricted subset](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed) of the [YAML](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/what-is-yaml)
specification.

Priorities:

- Beautiful API
- Refusing to parse [the ugly, hard to read and insecure features of YAML](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed) like [the Norway problem](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed).
- Strict validation of markup and straightforward type casting.
- Clear, readable exceptions with **code snippets** and **line numbers**.
- Acting as a near-drop in replacement for pyyaml, ruamel.yaml or poyo.
- Ability to read in YAML, make changes and write it out again with comments preserved.
- [Not speed](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/speed-not-a-priority), currently.


Simple example:

```yaml
# All about the character
name: Ford Prefect
age: 42
possessions:
- Towel

```


```python
from strictyaml import load, Map, Str, Int, Seq, YAMLError

```





Default parse result:


```python
>>> load(yaml_snippet)
YAML({'name': 'Ford Prefect', 'age': '42', 'possessions': ['Towel']})
```



All data is string, list or OrderedDict:


```python
>>> load(yaml_snippet).data
{'name': 'Ford Prefect', 'age': '42', 'possessions': ['Towel']}
```



Quickstart with schema:


```python
from strictyaml import load, Map, Str, Int, Seq, YAMLError

schema = Map({"name": Str(), "age": Int(), "possessions": Seq(Str())})

```





42 is now parsed as an integer:


```python
>>> person = load(yaml_snippet, schema)
>>> person.data
{'name': 'Ford Prefect', 'age': 42, 'possessions': ['Towel']}
```



A YAMLError will be raised if there are syntactic problems, violations of your schema or use of disallowed YAML features:

```yaml
# All about the character
name: Ford Prefect
age: 42

```






For example, a schema violation:


```python
try:
    person = load(yaml_snippet, schema)
except YAMLError as error:
    print(error)

```

```yaml
while parsing a mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 1, column 1:
    # All about the character
     ^ (line: 1)
required key(s) 'possessions' not found
  in "<unicode string>", line 3, column 1:
    age: '42'
    ^ (line: 3)
```





If parsed correctly:


```python
from strictyaml import load, Map, Str, Int, Seq, YAMLError, as_document

schema = Map({"name": Str(), "age": Int(), "possessions": Seq(Str())})

```





You can modify values and write out the YAML with comments preserved:


```python
person = load(yaml_snippet, schema)
person['age'] = 43
print(person.as_yaml())

```

```yaml
# All about the character
name: Ford Prefect
age: 43
possessions:
- Towel
```





As well as look up line numbers:


```python
>>> person = load(yaml_snippet, schema)
>>> person['possessions'][0].start_line
5
```



And construct YAML documents from dicts or lists:


```python
print(as_document({"x": 1}).as_yaml())

```

```yaml
x: 1
```







## Install

```sh
$ pip install strictyaml
```


## Why StrictYAML?

There are a number of formats and approaches that can achieve more or
less the same purpose as StrictYAML. I've tried to make it the best one.
Below is a series of documented justifications:

- [Why avoid using environment variables as configuration?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/environment-variables-as-config)
- [Why not use HJSON?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/hjson)
- [Why not HOCON?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/hocon)
- [Why not use INI files?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/ini)
- [Why not use JSON Schema for validation?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/json-schema)
- [Why not JSON for simple configuration files?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/json)
- [Why not JSON5?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/json5)

- [Why not use Python's schema library (or similar) for validation?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/python-schema)
- [Why not use SDLang?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/sdlang)
- [What is wrong with TOML?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/toml)
- [Why shouldn't I just use Python code for configuration?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/turing-complete-code)
- [Why not use XML for configuration or DSLs?](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/xml)
