        # [2/8/25, 23:28:24] Fernando Perez: Hi! Yes, this was my first public
        # announcement:
        # [2/8/25, 23:28:25] Fernando Perez:
        # https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2001-December/093408.html
        # [2/8/25, 23:28:55] Fernando Perez: All that started two months earlier
        # - in October 2001 I read this article:
        # [2/8/25, 23:28:55] Fernando Perez:
        # https://web.archive.org/web/20011202000624/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2001/10/11/pythonnews.html
        # [2/8/25, 23:29:05] Fernando Perez: Which is also archived here:
        # [2/8/25, 23:29:05] Fernando Perez:
        # https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/weblinux2/orn/interactive_python.html
        # [2/8/25, 23:29:48] Fernando Perez: That article put me on the trail of
        # LazyPython, and I also found out (can‚Äôt remember where) about IPP
        # (Interactive Python Prompt), another similar projecd by Janko Hauser.
        # [2/8/25, 23:30:20] Fernando Perez: A also read an article around that
        # time, about new features in Python 2.0, which spoke of how
        # sys.displayhook could be programmed to call any object you wanted.
        # [2/8/25, 23:31:01] Fernando Perez: Those things together gave me the
        # idea of implementing a stateful object, the ‚ÄúIPython Prompt‚Äù, that
        # could store a  cache of old results, Mathematica-style, and that could
        # have all kinds of other useful tricks up its sleeve.
        # [2/8/25, 23:31:17] Fernando Perez: I can‚Äôt remember if I did the
        # prompt stuff first and then read about LazyPython/IPP.
        # [2/8/25, 23:31:41] Fernando Perez: I do know that, implementation
        # wise, at first I just did the tiny IPython 0.0.1 that I posted much
        # later on github as a gist:
        # [2/8/25, 23:31:55] Fernando Perez:
        # https://gist.github.com/fperez/1579699
        # [2/8/25, 23:32:03] Fernando Perez: But I only shared that publicly
        # much later.
        # [2/8/25, 23:33:19] Fernando Perez: I did find out about IPP/LazyPython
        # sometime in October, contacted Janko and Nathan who told me to use
        # their code at will but said they were busy with other things, and got
        # cranking for a few mad weeks on what became the IPython 0.2.0 that I
        # posted about in that comp.lang.python thread of December 2001.
        # [2/8/25, 23:33:52] Fernando Perez: That period from Oct 11 to Dec 9
        # 2001 was maniacal coding, with very little sleep üôÇ
