    can safely create arbitrarily large numbers of FileManager objects.

    Don't directly close files acquired from a FileManager. Instead, call
    FileManager.close(), which ensures that closed files are removed from the
    cache as well.

    Example usage::

        manager = FileManager(open, "example.txt", mode="w")

        f.write(...)
        manager.close()  # ensures file is closed

        Parameters
        ----------
        opener : callable
            Function that when called like ``opener(*args, **kwargs)`` returns
            an open file object. The file object must implement a ``close()``
            method.
        *args
            Positional arguments for opener. A ``mode`` argument should be
            provided as a keyword argument (see below). All arguments must be
            hashable.
        mode : optional
            If provided, passed as a keyword argument to ``opener`` along with
            ``**kwargs``. ``mode='w' `` has special treatment: after the first
            call it is replaced by ``mode='a'`` in all subsequent function to
            avoid overriding the newly created file.
        kwargs : dict, optional
            Keyword arguments for opener, excluding ``mode``. All values must
            be hashable.
        lock : duck-compatible threading.Lock, optional
            Lock to use when modifying the cache inside acquire() and close().
            By default, uses a new threading.Lock() object. If set, this object
            should be pickleable.
        cache : MutableMapping, optional
            Mapping to use as a cache for open files. By default, uses xarray's
            global LRU file cache. Because ``cache`` typically points to a
            global variable and contains non-picklable file objects, an
            unpickled FileManager objects will be restored with the default
            cache.
        manager_id : hashable, optional
            Identifier for this CachingFileManager.
        ref_counts : dict, optional
            Optional dict to use for keeping track the number of references to
            the same file.
