"""A Python driver for PostgreSQL

psycopg is a PostgreSQL_ database adapter for the Python_ programming
language. This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to
provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other sweet
candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the aim of being very
small and fast, and stable as a rock.

    Create a new database connection.

    The connection parameters can be specified as a string:

        conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test user=postgres password=secret")

    or using a set of keyword arguments:

        conn = psycopg2.connect(database="test", user="postgres", password="secret")

    Or as a mix of both. The basic connection parameters are:

    - *dbname*: the database name
    - *database*: the database name (only as keyword argument)
    - *user*: user name used to authenticate
    - *password*: password used to authenticate
    - *host*: database host address (defaults to UNIX socket if not provided)
    - *port*: connection port number (defaults to 5432 if not provided)

    Using the *connection_factory* parameter a different class or connections
    factory can be specified. It should be a callable object taking a dsn
    argument.

    Using the *cursor_factory* parameter, a new default cursor factory will be
    used by cursor().

    Using *async*=True an asynchronous connection will be created. *async_* is
    a valid alias (for Python versions where ``async`` is a keyword).

    Any other keyword parameter will be passed to the underlying client
    library: the list of supported parameters depends on the library version.
