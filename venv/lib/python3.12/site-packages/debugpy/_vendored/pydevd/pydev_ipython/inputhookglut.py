# GLUT is quite an old library and it is difficult to ensure proper
# integration within IPython since original GLUT does not allow to handle
# events one by one. Instead, it requires for the mainloop to be entered
# and never returned (there is not even a function to exit he
# mainloop). Fortunately, there are alternatives such as freeglut
# (available for linux and windows) and the OSX implementation gives
# access to a glutCheckLoop() function that blocks itself until a new
# event is received. This means we have to setup the idle callback to
# ensure we got at least one event that will unblock the function.
#
# Furthermore, it is not possible to install these handlers without a window
# being first created. We choose to make this window invisible. This means that
# display mode options are set at this level and user won't be able to change
# them later without modifying the code. This should probably be made available
# via IPython options system.
