    Parameters
    ----------
    mgr : an InputHookManager

    app : Qt Application, optional.
        Running application to use.  If not given, we probe Qt for an
        existing application object, and create a new one if none is found.

    Returns
    -------
    A pair consisting of a Qt Application (either the one given or the
    one found or created) and a inputhook.

    Notes
    -----
    We use a custom input hook instead of PyQt5's default one, as it
    interacts better with the readline packages (issue #481).

    The inputhook function works in tandem with a 'pre_prompt_hook'
    which automatically restores the hook as an inputhook in case the
    latter has been temporarily disabled after having intercepted a
    KeyboardInterrupt.
