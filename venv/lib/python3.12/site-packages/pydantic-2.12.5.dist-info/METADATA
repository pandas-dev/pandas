## Pydantic V1.10 vs. V2

Pydantic V2 is a ground-up rewrite that offers many new features, performance improvements, and some breaking changes compared to Pydantic V1.

If you're using Pydantic V1 you may want to look at the
[pydantic V1.10 Documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or,
[`1.10.X-fixes` git branch](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tree/1.10.X-fixes). Pydantic V2 also ships with the latest version of Pydantic V1 built in so that you can incrementally upgrade your code base and projects: `from pydantic import v1 as pydantic_v1`.

## Help

See [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for more details.

## Installation

Install using `pip install -U pydantic` or `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.
For more installation options to make Pydantic even faster,
see the [Install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/) section in the documentation.

## A Simple Example

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: list[int] = []

external_data = {'id': '123', 'signup_ts': '2017-06-01 12:22', 'friends': [1, '2', b'3']}
user = User(**external_data)
print(user)
#> User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3]
print(user.id)
#> 123
```

## v2.12.5 (2025-11-26)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.5)

This is the fifth 2.12 patch release, addressing an issue with the `MISSING` sentinel and providing several documentation improvements.

The next 2.13 minor release will be published in a couple weeks, and will include a new *polymorphic serialization* feature addressing
the remaining unexpected changes to the *serialize as any* behavior.

* Fix pickle error when using `model_construct()` on a model with `MISSING` as a default value by [@ornariece](https://github.com/ornariece) in [#12522](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12522).
* Several updates to the documentation by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos).

## v2.12.4 (2025-11-05)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.4)

This is the fourth 2.12 patch release, fixing more regressions, and reverting a change in the `build()` method
of the [`AnyUrl` and Dsn types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/).

This patch release also fixes an issue with the serialization of IP address types, when `serialize_as_any` is used. The next patch release
will try to address the remaining issues with *serialize as any* behavior by introducing a new *polymorphic serialization* feature, that
should be used in most cases in place of *serialize as any*.

* Fix issue with forward references in parent `TypedDict` classes by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12427](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12427).

    This issue is only relevant on Python 3.14 and greater.
* Exclude fields with `exclude_if` from JSON Schema required fields by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12430](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12430)
* Revert URL percent-encoding of credentials in the `build()` method
  of the [`AnyUrl` and Dsn types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/) by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in
  [pydantic-core#1833](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1833).

    This was initially considered as a bugfix, but caused regressions and as such was fully reverted. The next release will include
    an opt-in option to percent-encode components of the URL.
* Add type inference for IP address types by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1868](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1868).

    The 2.12 changes to the `serialize_as_any` behavior made it so that IP address types could not properly serialize to JSON.
* Avoid getting default values from defaultdict by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1853](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1853).

    This fixes a subtle regression in the validation behavior of the [`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)
    type.
* Fix issue with field serializers on nested typed dictionaries by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1879](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1879).
* Add more `pydantic-core` builds for the three-threaded version of Python 3.14 by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1864](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1864).

## v2.12.3 (2025-10-17)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.3)

### What's Changed

This is the third 2.12 patch release, fixing issues related to the `FieldInfo` class, and reverting a change to the supported
[*after* model validator](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#model-validators) function signatures.

* Raise a warning when an invalid after model validator function signature is raised by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12414](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12414).
  Starting in 2.12.0, using class methods for *after* model validators raised an error, but the error wasn't raised concistently. We decided
  to emit a deprecation warning instead.
* Add [`FieldInfo.asdict()`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo.asdict) method, improve documentation around `FieldInfo` by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12411](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12411).
  This also add back support for mutations on `FieldInfo` classes, that are reused as `Annotated` metadata. **However**, note that this is still
  *not* a supported pattern. Instead, please refer to the [added example](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/examples/dynamic_models/) in the documentation.

The [blog post](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-v2-12-release#changes) section on changes was also updated to document the changes related to `serialize_as_any`.

## v2.12.2 (2025-10-14)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.2)

### What's Changed

#### Fixes

* Release a new `pydantic-core` version, as a corrupted CPython 3.10 `manylinux2014_aarch64` wheel got uploaded ([pydantic-core#1843](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1843)).
* Fix issue with recursive generic models with a parent model class by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12398](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12398)

## v2.12.1 (2025-10-13)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.1)

### What's Changed

This is the first 2.12 patch release, addressing most (but not all yet) regressions from the initial 2.12.0 release.

* Encode credentials in `MultiHostUrl` builder by [@willswire](https://github.com/willswire) in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)
* Respect field serializers when using `serialize_as_any` serialization flag by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)
* Fix various `RootModel` serialization issues by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1836](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1836)
