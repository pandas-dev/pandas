IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most out of using Python
interactively.  Its main components are:

 * A powerful interactive Python shell
 * A `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter
   notebooks and other interactive frontends.

The enhanced interactive Python shells have the following main features:

 * Comprehensive object introspection.

 * Input history, persistent across sessions.

 * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
   references.

 * Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python
   variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.

 * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
   performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.

 * A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups
   (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).

 * Session logging and reloading.

 * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.

 * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.

 * Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.

 * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.

The latest development version is always available from IPython's `GitHub
site <http://github.com/ipython>`_.
