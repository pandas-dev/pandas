"""
A collection of `ctypes` type aliases for several numpy scalar types.

NOTE:
    `optype.numpy` assumes a `C99`-compatible C compiler, a 32 or 64-bit
    system, and a `ILP32`, `LLP64` or `LP64` data model; see
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/arithmetic_types for more info.

    If this is not the case for you, then please open an issue at:
