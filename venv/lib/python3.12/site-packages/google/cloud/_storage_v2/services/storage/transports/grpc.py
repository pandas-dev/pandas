    API Overview and Naming Syntax
    ------------------------------

    The Cloud Storage gRPC API allows applications to read and write
    data through the abstractions of buckets and objects. For a
    description of these abstractions please see
    https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs.

    Resources are named as follows:

    - Projects are referred to as they are defined by the Resource
      Manager API, using strings like ``projects/123456`` or
      ``projects/my-string-id``.

    - Buckets are named using string names of the form:
      ``projects/{project}/buckets/{bucket}`` For globally unique
      buckets, ``_`` may be substituted for the project.

    - Objects are uniquely identified by their name along with the name
      of the bucket they belong to, as separate strings in this API. For
      example:

      ReadObjectRequest { bucket: 'projects/\_/buckets/my-bucket'
      object: 'my-object' } Note that object names can contain ``/``
      characters, which are treated as any other character (no special
      directory semantics).

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

            credentials (Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]): The
                authorization credentials to attach to requests. These
                credentials identify the application to the service; if none
                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the
                credentials from the environment.
                This argument is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            credentials_file (Optional[str]): A file with credentials that can
                be loaded with :func:`google.auth.load_credentials_from_file`.
                This argument is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            scopes (Optional(Sequence[str])): A list of scopes. This argument is
                ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            channel (Optional[Union[grpc.Channel, Callable[..., grpc.Channel]]]):
                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``
                is used to create the channel. If a Callable is given, it will be called
                with the same arguments as used in ``self.create_channel``.
            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create
                a mutual TLS channel with client SSL credentials from
                ``client_cert_source`` or application default SSL credentials.
            client_cert_source (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]):
                Deprecated. A callback to provide client SSL certificate bytes and
                private key bytes, both in PEM format. It is ignored if
                ``api_mtls_endpoint`` is None.
            ssl_channel_credentials (grpc.ChannelCredentials): SSL credentials
                for the grpc channel. It is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            client_cert_source_for_mtls (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]):
                A callback to provide client certificate bytes and private key bytes,

                ignored if a ``channel`` instance or ``ssl_channel_credentials`` is provided.
            quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.

        Stores a new object and metadata.

        An object can be written either in a single message stream or in
        a resumable sequence of message streams. To write using a single
        stream, the client should include in the first message of the
        stream an ``WriteObjectSpec`` describing the destination bucket,
        object, and any preconditions. Additionally, the final message
        must set 'finish_write' to true, or else it is an error.

        For a resumable write, the client should instead call
        ``StartResumableWrite()``, populating a ``WriteObjectSpec`` into
        that request. They should then attach the returned ``upload_id``
        to the first message of each following call to ``WriteObject``.
        If the stream is closed before finishing the upload (either
        explicitly by the client or due to a network error or an error
        response from the server), the client should do as follows:

        - Check the result Status of the stream, to determine if writing
          can be resumed on this stream or must be restarted from
          scratch (by calling ``StartResumableWrite()``). The resumable
          errors are DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, INTERNAL, and UNAVAILABLE. For
          each case, the client should use binary exponential backoff
          before retrying. Additionally, writes can be resumed after
          RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors, but only after taking appropriate
          measures, which may include reducing aggregate send rate
          across clients and/or requesting a quota increase for your
          project.
        - If the call to ``WriteObject`` returns ``ABORTED``, that
          indicates concurrent attempts to update the resumable write,
          caused either by multiple racing clients or by a single client
          where the previous request was timed out on the client side
          but nonetheless reached the server. In this case the client
          should take steps to prevent further concurrent writes (e.g.,
          increase the timeouts, stop using more than one process to
          perform the upload, etc.), and then should follow the steps
          below for resuming the upload.
        - For resumable errors, the client should call
          ``QueryWriteStatus()`` and then continue writing from the
          returned ``persisted_size``. This may be less than the amount
          of data the client previously sent. Note also that it is
          acceptable to send data starting at an offset earlier than the
          returned ``persisted_size``; in this case, the service will
          skip data at offsets that were already persisted (without
          checking that it matches the previously written data), and
          write only the data starting from the persisted offset. Even
          though the data isn't written, it may still incur a
          performance cost over resuming at the correct write offset.
          This behavior can make client-side handling simpler in some
          cases.
        - Clients must only send data that is a multiple of 256 KiB per
          message, unless the object is being finished with
          ``finish_write`` set to ``true``.

        The service will not view the object as complete until the
        client has sent a ``WriteObjectRequest`` with ``finish_write``
        set to ``true``. Sending any requests on a stream after sending
        a request with ``finish_write`` set to ``true`` will cause an
        error. The client **should** check the response it receives to
        determine how much data the service was able to commit and
        whether the service views the object as complete.

        Attempting to resume an already finalized object will result in
        an OK status, with a ``WriteObjectResponse`` containing the
        finalized object's metadata.

        Alternatively, the BidiWriteObject operation may be used to
        write an object with controls over flushing and the ability to
        fetch the ability to determine the current persisted size.
