## Python library for Apache Arrow

[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyarrow.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/) [![conda-forge](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/pyarrow.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyarrow)

This library provides a Python API for functionality provided by the Arrow C++
libraries, along with tools for Arrow integration and interoperability with
pandas, NumPy, and other software in the Python ecosystem.

## Installing

Across platforms, you can install a recent version of pyarrow with the conda
package manager:

```shell
conda install pyarrow -c conda-forge
```

On Linux, macOS, and Windows, you can also install binary wheels from PyPI with
pip:

```shell
pip install pyarrow
```

If you encounter any issues importing the pip wheels on Windows, you may need
to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015][6].

## Development

See [Python Development][2] in the documentation subproject.
