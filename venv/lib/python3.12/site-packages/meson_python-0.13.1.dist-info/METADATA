build system. It enables to use Meson for the configuration and build
steps of Python packages. Meson is an open source build system meant
to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user
friendly as possible. ``meson-python`` is best suited for building
Python packages containing extension modules implemented in languages
such as C, C++, Cython, Fortran, Pythran, or Rust. Consult the
documentation__ for more details.
