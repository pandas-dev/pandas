           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# pyjson5

A Python implementation of the JSON5 data format.

[JSON5](https://json5.org) extends the
[JSON](http://www.json.org) data interchange format to make it
slightly more usable as a configuration language:

* JavaScript-style comments (both single and multi-line) are legal.

* Object keys may be unquoted if they are legal ECMAScript identifiers

* Objects and arrays may end with trailing commas.

* Strings can be single-quoted, and multi-line string literals are allowed.

There are a few other more minor extensions to JSON; see the above page for
the full details.

This project implements a reader and writer implementation for Python;
where possible, it mirrors the
[standard Python JSON API](https://docs.python.org/library/json.html)
package for ease of use.

There is one notable difference from the JSON api: the `load()` and
`loads()` methods support optionally checking for (and rejecting) duplicate
object keys; pass `allow_duplicate_keys=False` to do so (duplicates are
allowed by default).

This is an early release. It has been reasonably well-tested, but it is
**SLOW**. It can be 1000-6000x slower than the C-optimized JSON module,
and is 200x slower (or more) than the pure Python JSON module.

**Please Note:** This library only handles JSON5 documents, it does not
allow you to read arbitrary JavaScript. For example, bare integers can
be legal object keys in JavaScript, but they aren't in JSON5.

## Known issues

* Did I mention that it is **SLOW**?

* The implementation follows Python3's `json` implementation where
  possible. This means that the `encoding` method to `dump()` is
  ignored, and unicode strings are always returned.

* The `cls` keyword argument that `json.load()`/`json.loads()` accepts
  to specify a custom subclass of ``JSONDecoder`` is not and will not be
  supported, because this implementation uses a completely different
  approach to parsing strings and doesn't have anything like the
  `JSONDecoder` class.

* The `cls` keyword argument that `json.dump()`/`json.dumps()` accepts
  is also not supported, for consistency with `json5.load()`. The `default`
  keyword *is* supported, though, and might be able to serve as a
  workaround.

## Contributing

#### On Mac

The easiest thing to do is to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) and
use `uv` and the `//run` script to develop things. See `./run --help` for
the various commands that are supported. `glop` is the parser generator
tool used to generate a parser from the grammar in `json5/json5.g`.

```
$ brew install uv
$ git clone https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5
$ git clone https://github.com/dpranke/glop
$ cd pyjson5
$ source $(./run devenv)  # To activate a venv w/ all the needed dev tools.
```

#### On other platforms

Install `uv` via whatever mechanism is appropriate.

### Create the venv

```
$ ./run devenv
```

(This calls `uv sync --extra dev`.)

### Running the tests

```
$ ./run tests
```

### Updating the packages

```
# Update the version in json5/version.py to $VERSION, which should be of
# the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are numbers.
$ ./run regen
$ ./run presubmit
$ git commit -a -m "Bump the version to $VERSION"
$ git tag "v$VERSION"
$ ./run build
$ ./run publish --prod
$ git push origin
$ git push --tags origin
```

(Assuming you have upload privileges to PyPI and the GitHub repo, of course.)

## Version History / Release Notes

* v0.11.0 (2025-04-01)
    * Add a couple examples to the documentation and run doctest over
      them.
    * Fix a typing issue in dump and dumps with the `cls` argument; turns
      out mypy was right and I was wrong and I didn't realize it :).
    * Introduce a new `parse` method that can be used to iterate through
      a string, extracting multiple values.
    * Add a new `consume_trailing` parameter to `load`/`loads`/`parse`
      that specifies whether to keep parsing after a valid object is
      reached. By default, this is True and the string must only contain
      trailing whitespace. If set to False, parsing will stop when a
      valid object is reached.
    * Add a new `start` parameter to `load`/`loads`/`parse` to specify
      the zero-based offset to start parsing the string or file from.
    * [GitHub issue #60](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/60).
      Fix a bug where we were attempting to allow '--4' as a valid number.

* v0.10.0 (2024-11-25)
    * [GitHub issue #57](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/57).
      Added a `JSON5Encoder` class that can be overridden to do custom
      encoding of values. This class is vaguely similar to the `JSONEncoder`
      class in the standard `json` library, except that it has an
      `encode()` method that can be overridden to customize *any*
      value, not just ones the standard encoder doesn't know how to handle.
      It does also support a `default()` method that can be used to
      encode things not normally encodable, like the JSONEncoder class.
      It does not support an `iterencode` method. One could probably
      be added in the future, although exactly how that would work and
      interact with `encode` is a little unclear.
    * Restructured the code to use the new encoder class; doing so actually
      allowed me to delete a bunch of tediously duplicative code.
    * Added a new `quote_style` argument to `dump()`/`dumps()` to control
      how strings are encoded by default. For compatibility with older
      versions of the json5 library and the standard json library, it
      uses `QuoteStyle.ALWAYS_DOUBLE` which encodes all strings with double
      quotes all the time. You can also configure it to use single quotes
      all the time (`ALWAYS_SINGLE`), and to switch between single and double
      when doing so eliminates a need to escape quotes (`PREFER_SINGLE` and
      `PREFER_DOUBLE`). This also adds a `--quote-style` argument to
      `python -m json5`.
    * This release has a fair number of changes, but is intended to be
      completely backwards-compatible. Code without changes should run exactly
      as it did before.
* v0.9.28 (2024-11-11)
    * Fix GitHub CI to install `uv` so `./run tests` works properly.
    * Mark Python3.13 as supported in package metadata.
    * Update dev package dependencies (note that the latest versions
      of coverage and pylint no longer work w/ Python3.8)
* v0.9.27 (2024-11-10)
    * Fix typo in //README.md
* v0.9.26 (2024-11-10)
    * [GitHub issue #82](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/82)
      Add support for the `strict` parameter to `load()`/`loads()`.
    * Significantly rework the infra and the `run` script to be
      contemporary.
* v0.9.25 (2024-04-12)
    * [GitHub issue #81](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/81)
      Explicitly specify the directory to use for the package in
      pyproject.toml.
* v0.9.24 (2024-03-16)
    * Update GitHub workflow config to remove unnecessary steps and
      run on pull requests as well as commits.
    * Added note about removing `hypothesize` in v0.9.23.
    * No code changes.
* v0.9.23 (2024-03-16)
    * Lots of cleanup:
      * Removed old code needed for Python2 compatibility.
      * Removed tests using `hypothesize`. This ran model-based checks
        and didn't really add anything useful in terms of coverage to
        the test suite, and it introduced dependencies and slowed down
        the tests significantly. It was a good experiment but I think
        we're better off without it.
      * Got everything linting cleanly with pylint 3.1 and `ruff check`
        using ruff 0.3.3 (Note that commit message in 00d73a3 says pylint
        3.11, which is a typo).
      * Code reformatted with `ruff format`
      * Added missing tests to bring coverage up to 100%.
      * Lots of minor code changes as the result of linting and coverage
        testing, but no intentional functional differences.
* v0.9.22 (2024-03-06)
    * Attempt to fix the GitHub CI configuration now that setup.py
      is gone. Also, test on 3.12 instead of 3.11.
    * No code changes.
* v0.9.21 (2024-03-06)
    * Moved the benchmarks/*.json data files' license information
      to //LICENSE to (hopefully) make the Google linter happy.
* v0.9.20 (2024-03-03)
    * Added `json5.__version__` in addition to `json5.VERSION`.
    * More packaging modernization (no more setup.{cfg,py} files).
    * Mark Python3.12 as supported in project.classifiers.
    * Updated the `//run` script to use python3.
* v0.9.19 (2024-03-03)
    * Replaced the benchmarking data files that came from chromium.org with
      three files obtained from other datasets on GitHub. Since this repo
      is vendored into the chromium/src repo it was occasionally confusing
      people who thought the data was actually used for non-benchmarking
      purposes and thus updating it for whatever reason.
    * No code changes.
* v0.9.18 (2024-02-29)
    * Add typing information to the module. This is kind of a big change,
      but there should be no functional differences.
* v0.9.17 (2024-02-19)
    * Move from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`.
    * No code changes (other than the version increasing).
* v0.9.16 (2024-02-19)
    * Drop Python2 from `setup.py`
    * Add minimal packaging instructions to `//README.md`.
* v0.9.15 (2024-02-19)
    * Merge in [Pull request #66](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/66)
      to include the tests and sample file in a source distribution.
* v0.9.14 (2023-05-14)
    * [GitHub issue #63](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/63)
      Handle `+Infinity` as well as `-Infinity` and `Infinity`.
* v0.9.13 (2023-03-16)
    * [GitHub PR #64](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/64)
      Remove a field from one of the JSON benchmark files to
      reduce confusion in Chromium.
    * No code changes.
* v0.9.12 (2023-01-02)
    * Fix GitHub Actions config file to no longer test against
      Python 3.6 or 3.7. For now we will only test against an
      "oldest" release (3.8 in this case) and a "current"
      release (3.11 in this case).
* v0.9.11 (2023-01-02)
    * [GitHub issue #60](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/60)
      Fixed minor Python2 compatibility issue by referring to
      `float("inf")` instead of `math.inf`.
* v0.9.10 (2022-08-18)
    * [GitHub issue #58](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/58)
      Updated the //README.md to be clear that parsing arbitrary JS
      code may not work.
    * Otherwise, no code changes.
* v0.9.9 (2022-08-01)
    * [GitHub issue #57](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/57)
      Fixed serialization for objects that subclass `int` or `float`:
      Previously we would use the objects __str__ implementation, but
      that might result in an illegal JSON5 value if the object had
      customized __str__ to return something illegal. Instead,
      we follow the lead of the `JSON` module and call `int.__repr__`
      or `float.__repr__` directly.
    * While I was at it, I added tests for dumps(-inf) and dumps(nan)
      when those were supposed to be disallowed by `allow_nan=False`.
* v0.9.8 (2022-05-08)
    * [GitHub issue #47](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/47)
      Fixed error reporting in some cases due to how parsing was handling
      nested rules in the grammar - previously the reported location for
      the error could be far away from the point where it actually happened.

* v0.9.7 (2022-05-06)
    * [GitHub issue #52](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/52)
      Fixed behavior of `default` fn in `dump` and `dumps`. Previously
      we didn't require the function to return a string, and so we could
      end up returning something that wasn't actually valid. This change
      now matches the behavior in the `json` module. *Note: This is a
      potentially breaking change.*
* v0.9.6 (2021-06-21)
    * Bump development status classifier to 5 - Production/Stable, which
      the library feels like it is at this point. If I do end up significantly
      reworking things to speed it up and/or to add round-trip editing,
      that'll likely be a 2.0. If this version has no reported issues,
      I'll likely promote it to 1.0.
    * Also bump the tested Python versions to 2.7, 3.8 and 3.9, though
      earlier Python3 versions will likely continue to work as well.
    * [GitHub issue #46](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/36)
      Fix incorrect serialization of custom subtypes
    * Make it possible to run the tests if `hypothesis` isn't installed.

* v0.9.5 (2020-05-26)
    * Miscellaneous non-source cleanups in the repo, including setting
      up GitHub Actions for a CI system. No changes to the library from
      v0.9.4, other than updating the version.

* v0.9.4 (2020-03-26)
    * [GitHub pull #38](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/38)
      Fix from fredrik@fornwall.net for dumps() crashing when passed
      an empty string as a key in an object.

* v0.9.3 (2020-03-17)
    * [GitHub pull #35](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/35)
      Fix from pastelmind@ for dump() not passing the right args to dumps().
    * Fix from p.skouzos@novafutur.com to remove the tests directory from
      the setup call, making the package a bit smaller.

* v0.9.2 (2020-03-02)
    * [GitHub pull #34](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/34)
      Fix from roosephu@ for a badly formatted nested list.

* v0.9.1 (2020-02-09)
    * [GitHub issue #33](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/33):
       Fix stray trailing comma when dumping an object with an invalid key.

* v0.9.0 (2020-01-30)
    * [GitHub issue #29](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/29):
       Fix an issue where objects keys that started with a reserved
       word were incorrectly quoted.
    * [GitHub issue #30](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/30):
       Fix an issue where dumps() incorrectly thought a data structure
       was cyclic in some cases.
    * [GitHub issue #32](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/32):
       Allow for non-string keys in dicts passed to ``dump()``/``dumps()``.
       Add an ``allow_duplicate_keys=False`` to prevent possible
       ill-formed JSON that might result.

* v0.8.5 (2019-07-04)
    * [GitHub issue #25](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/25):
      Add LICENSE and README.md to the dist.
    * [GitHub issue #26](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/26):
      Fix printing of empty arrays and objects with indentation, fix
      misreporting of the position on parse failures in some cases.

* v0.8.4 (2019-06-11)
    * Updated the version history, too.

* v0.8.3 (2019-06-11)
    * Tweaked the README, bumped the version, forgot to update the version
      history :).

* v0.8.2 (2019-06-11)
    * Actually bump the version properly, to 0.8.2.

* v0.8.1 (2019-06-11)
    * Fix bug in setup.py that messed up the description. Unfortunately,
      I forgot to bump the version for this, so this also identifies as 0.8.0.

* v0.8.0 (2019-06-11)
    * Add `allow_duplicate_keys=True` as a default argument to
      `json5.load()`/`json5.loads()`. If you set the key to `False`, duplicate
      keys in a single dict will be rejected. The default is set to `True`
      for compatibility with `json.load()`, earlier versions of json5, and
      because it's simply not clear if people would want duplicate checking
      enabled by default.

* v0.7 (2019-03-31)
    * Changes dump()/dumps() to not quote object keys by default if they are
      legal identifiers. Passing `quote_keys=True` will turn that off
      and always quote object keys.
    * Changes dump()/dumps() to insert trailing commas after the last item
      in an array or an object if the object is printed across multiple lines
      (i.e., if `indent` is not None). Passing `trailing_commas=False` will
      turn that off.
    * The `json5.tool` command line tool now supports the `--indent`,
      `--[no-]quote-keys`, and `--[no-]trailing-commas` flags to allow
      for more control over the output, in addition to the existing
      `--as-json` flag.
    * The `json5.tool` command line tool no longer supports reading from
      multiple files, you can now only read from a single file or
      from standard input.
    * The implementation no longer relies on the standard `json` module
      for anything. The output should still match the json module (except
      as noted above) and discrepancies should be reported as bugs.

* v0.6.2 (2019-03-08)
    * Fix [GitHub issue #23](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/23) and
      pass through unrecognized escape sequences.

* v0.6.1 (2018-05-22)
    * Cleaned up a couple minor nits in the package.

* v0.6.0 (2017-11-28)
    * First implementation that attempted to implement 100% of the spec.

* v0.5.0 (2017-09-04)
    * First implementation that supported the full set of kwargs that
      the `json` module supports.
