# Import of inspect.getcallargs() included for backward compatibility. An
# implementation of this was previously bundled and made available here for
# Python <2.7. Avoid using this in future.


# Variant of inspect.formatargspec() included here for forward compatibility.
# This is being done because Python 3.11 dropped inspect.formatargspec() but
# code for handling signature changing decorators relied on it. Exposing the
# bundled implementation here in case any user of wrapt was also needing it.
