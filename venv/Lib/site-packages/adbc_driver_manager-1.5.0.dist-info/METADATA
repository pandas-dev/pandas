# ADBC Driver Manager for Python

This package contains bindings for the ADBC Driver Manager, as well as a
[DBAPI 2.0/PEP 249-compatible][dbapi] interface on top.  This can be used to
load ADBC drivers at runtime and use them from Python.  Backend-specific
packages like `adbc_driver_postgresql` wrap this package in a more convenient
interface, and should be preferred where they exist.

The DBAPI 2.0 interface requires PyArrow, and exposes a number of extensions
mimicking those of [Turbodbc][turbodbc] or [DuckDB][duckdb]'s Python packages
to allow you to retrieve Arrow Table objects instead of being limited to the
row-oriented API of the base DBAPI interface.

[dbapi]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/
[duckdb]: https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/overview
[turbodbc]: https://turbodbc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Building

Dependencies: a C++ compiler.

For users building from the arrow-adbc source repository, you can alternately use CMake to manage library dependencies and set environment variables for you. You can add ``-DADBC_BUILD_PYTHON=ON`` to define a ``python`` target.

For example, assuming you run cmake from the project root:

```shell
cmake -S c -B build --preset debug -DADBC_BUILD_PYTHON=ON
cmake --build build --target python
```

will properly build and install the Python library for you.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Testing

The [SQLite driver](../../c/driver/sqlite/README.md) must be loadable
at runtime (e.g. it must be on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
or `PATH`).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

```shell
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/sqlite/driver/
$ pytest -vvx
```
