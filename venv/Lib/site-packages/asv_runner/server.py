def recvall(sock, size):
    """
    Receives data from a socket until the specified size of data has been received.

    #### Parameters
    **sock** (`socket`)
    : The socket from which the data will be received. This socket should
    already be connected to the other end from which data is to be received.

    **size** (`int`)
    : The total size of data to be received from the socket.

    #### Returns
    **data** (`bytes`)
    : The data received from the socket. The length of this data will be equal
    to the size specified.

    #### Raises
    **RuntimeError**
    : If the socket closed before the specified size of data could be received.

    #### Notes
    This function continuously receives data from the provided socket in a loop
    until the total length of the received data is equal to the specified size.
    If the socket closes before the specified size of data could be received, a
    `RuntimeError` is raised. The function returns the received data as a byte
    string.

def _run_server(args):
    """
    Runs a server that executes benchmarks based on the received commands.

    #### Parameters
    **args** (`tuple`)
    : A tuple containing the benchmark directory and socket name.

    - `benchmark_dir` (`str`): The directory where the benchmarks are located.
    - `socket_name` (`str`): The name of the UNIX socket to be used for
    - communication.

    #### Raises
    **RuntimeError**
    : If the received command contains unknown data.

    #### Notes
    This function creates a server that listens on a UNIX socket for commands.
    It can perform two actions based on the received command: quit or preimport
    benchmarks.

    If the command is "quit", the server stops running. If the command is
    "preimport", the function imports all the benchmarks in the specified
    directory, capturing all the I/O to a file during import. After the
    benchmarks are imported, the function sends the contents of the output file
    back through the socket.

    If the action is not "quit" or "preimport", the function assumes it is a
    command to run a specific benchmark. It then runs the benchmark and waits
    for the results. It also handles a timeout for the benchmark execution and
    sends the results back through the socket.

    The function continuously accepts new commands until it receives a "quit"
    command or a KeyboardInterrupt.

    It uses UNIX domain sockets for inter-process communication. The name of the
    socket is passed as a parameter in `args`. The socket is created, bound to
    the socket name, and set to listen for connections. When a connection is
    accepted, the command is read from the socket, parsed, and executed
    accordingly. After executing the command, the server sends back the result
    through the socket and waits for the next command.
