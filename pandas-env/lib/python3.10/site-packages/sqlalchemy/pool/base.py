        :param creator: a callable function that returns a DB-API
          connection object.  The function will be called with
          parameters.

        :param recycle: If set to a value other than -1, number of
          seconds between connection recycling, which means upon
          checkout, if this timeout is surpassed the connection will be
          closed and replaced with a newly opened connection. Defaults to -1.

        :param logging_name:  String identifier which will be used within
          the "name" field of logging records generated within the
          "sqlalchemy.pool" logger. Defaults to a hexstring of the object's
          id.

        :param echo: if True, the connection pool will log
         informational output such as when connections are invalidated
         as well as when connections are recycled to the default log handler,
         which defaults to ``sys.stdout`` for output..   If set to the string
         ``"debug"``, the logging will include pool checkouts and checkins.

         The :paramref:`_pool.Pool.echo` parameter can also be set from the
         :func:`_sa.create_engine` call by using the
         :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.echo_pool` parameter.

         .. seealso::

             :ref:`dbengine_logging` - further detail on how to configure
             logging.

        :param reset_on_return: Determine steps to take on
         connections as they are returned to the pool, which were
         not otherwise handled by a :class:`_engine.Connection`.
         Available from :func:`_sa.create_engine` via the
         :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_reset_on_return` parameter.

         :paramref:`_pool.Pool.reset_on_return` can have any of these values:

         * ``"rollback"`` - call rollback() on the connection,
           to release locks and transaction resources.
           This is the default value.  The vast majority
           of use cases should leave this value set.
         * ``"commit"`` - call commit() on the connection,
           to release locks and transaction resources.
           A commit here may be desirable for databases that
           cache query plans if a commit is emitted,
           such as Microsoft SQL Server.  However, this
           value is more dangerous than 'rollback' because
           any data changes present on the transaction
           are committed unconditionally.
         * ``None`` - don't do anything on the connection.
           This setting may be appropriate if the database / DBAPI
           works in pure "autocommit" mode at all times, or if
           a custom reset handler is established using the
           :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event handler.

         * ``True`` - same as 'rollback', this is here for
           backwards compatibility.
         * ``False`` - same as None, this is here for
           backwards compatibility.

         For further customization of reset on return, the
         :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event hook may be used which can perform
         any connection activity desired on reset.

         .. seealso::

            :ref:`pool_reset_on_return`

            :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset`

        :param events: a list of 2-tuples, each of the form
         ``(callable, target)`` which will be passed to :func:`.event.listen`
         upon construction.   Provided here so that event listeners
         can be assigned via :func:`_sa.create_engine` before dialect-level
         listeners are applied.

        :param dialect: a :class:`.Dialect` that will handle the job
         of calling rollback(), close(), or commit() on DBAPI connections.
         If omitted, a built-in "stub" dialect is used.   Applications that
         make use of :func:`_sa.create_engine` should not use this parameter
         as it is handled by the engine creation strategy.

        :param pre_ping: if True, the pool will emit a "ping" (typically
         "SELECT 1", but is dialect-specific) on the connection
         upon checkout, to test if the connection is alive or not.   If not,
         the connection is transparently re-connected and upon success, all
         other pooled connections established prior to that timestamp are
         invalidated.     Requires that a dialect is passed as well to
         interpret the disconnection error.

    """Proxies a DBAPI connection and provides return-on-dereference
    support.

    This is an internal object used by the :class:`_pool.Pool` implementation
    to provide context management to a DBAPI connection delivered by
    that :class:`_pool.Pool`.   The public facing interface for this class
    is described by the :class:`.PoolProxiedConnection` class.  See that
    class for public API details.

    The name "fairy" is inspired by the fact that the
    :class:`._ConnectionFairy` object's lifespan is transitory, as it lasts
    only for the length of a specific DBAPI connection being checked out from
    the pool, and additionally that as a transparent proxy, it is mostly
    invisible.
