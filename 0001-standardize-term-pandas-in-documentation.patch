 A possible fix for the lack of the `lzma` module is to ensure you have the necessary libraries and then re-install Python.
 For example, on MacOS installing Python with `pyenv` may lead to an incomplete Python installation due to unmet system dependencies at compilation time (like `xz`). Compilation will succeed, but Python might fail at run time. The issue can be solved by installing the necessary dependencies and then re-installing Python.
