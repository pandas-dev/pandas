airspeed velocity
=================

**airspeed velocity** (``asv``) is a tool for benchmarking Python
packages over their lifetime.  Runtime, memory consumption and even
custom-computed values may be tracked.  The results are displayed in
an interactive web frontend that requires only a basic static
webserver to host.

See examples of Airspeed Velocity websites:
`astropy <https://www.astropy.org/astropy-benchmarks/>`__,
`numpy <https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/>`__,
`scipy <https://pv.github.io/scipy-bench/>`__.
