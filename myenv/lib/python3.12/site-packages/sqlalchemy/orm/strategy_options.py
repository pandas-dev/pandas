        This function is part of the :class:`_orm.Load` interface and supports

        The option is used in conjunction with an explicit join that loads
        the desired rows, i.e.::

            sess.query(Order).join(Order.user).options(

        ``User`` entity, and the returned ``Order`` objects would have the
        ``Order.user`` attribute pre-populated.

        It may also be used for customizing the entries in an eagerly loaded
        collection; queries will normally want to use the
        :ref:`orm_queryguide_populate_existing` execution option assuming the
        primary collection of parent objects may already have been loaded::

            ).options(contains_eager(User.addresses)).populate_existing()

        eager loading.

        This function is part of the :class:`_orm.Load` interface and supports

        examples::

            # joined-load the "orders" collection on "User"
            select(User).options(joinedload(User.orders))

            # joined-load Order.items and then Item.keywords

        :param innerjoin: if ``True``, indicates that the joined eager load
         should use an inner join instead of the default of left outer join::

            select(Order).options(joinedload(Order.user, innerjoin=True))

        In order to chain multiple eager joins together where some may be
        OUTER and others INNER, right-nested joins are used to link them::

            select(A).options(
                joinedload(A.bs, innerjoin=False).joinedload(
                    B.cs, innerjoin=True
                )
            )

        The above query, linking A.bs via "outer" join and B.cs via "inner"
        join would render the joins as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN (b JOIN c)". When
        using older versions of SQLite (< 3.7.16), this form of JOIN is
        translated to use full subqueries as this syntax is otherwise not
        directly supported.

        The ``innerjoin`` flag can also be stated with the term ``"unnested"``.
        This indicates that an INNER JOIN should be used, *unless* the join
        is linked to a LEFT OUTER JOIN to the left, in which case it
        will render as LEFT OUTER JOIN.  For example, supposing ``A.bs``
        is an outerjoin::

            select(A).options(
                joinedload(A.bs).joinedload(B.cs, innerjoin="unnested")
            )


        The above join will render as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN b LEFT OUTER JOIN c",
        rather than as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN (b JOIN c)".

        .. note:: The "unnested" flag does **not** affect the JOIN rendered
            from a many-to-many association table, e.g. a table configured as
            :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`, to the target table; for
            correctness of results, these joins are always INNER and are
            therefore right-nested if linked to an OUTER join.

        .. note::

            The joins produced by :func:`_orm.joinedload` are **anonymously
            aliased**. The criteria by which the join proceeds cannot be
            modified, nor can the ORM-enabled :class:`_sql.Select` or legacy
            :class:`_query.Query` refer to these joins in any way, including
            ordering. See :ref:`zen_of_eager_loading` for further detail.

            To produce a specific SQL JOIN which is explicitly available, use
            :meth:`_sql.Select.join` and :meth:`_query.Query.join`. To combine
            explicit JOINs with eager loading of collections, use

        along the chain.  For example, to set joined eager loading for an
        element of an element::

            session.query(MyClass).options(
                defaultload(MyClass.someattribute).joinedload(
                    MyOtherClass.someotherattribute
                )
            )

        :func:`.defaultload` is also useful for setting column-level options on
        a related class, namely that of :func:`.defer` and :func:`.undefer`::

            session.scalars(
                select(MyClass).options(
                    defaultload(MyClass.someattribute)

                    .undefer("some_other_column")

        :param raiseload: raise :class:`.InvalidRequestError` rather than
