botocore
========

|Version| |Python| |License|

A low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web Services. The
botocore package is the foundation for the
`AWS CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__ as well as
`boto3 <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`__.

Botocore is maintained and published by `Amazon Web Services`_.

Notices
-------

On 2023-12-13, support was dropped for Python 3.7. This follows the
Python Software Foundation `end of support <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/#lifespan>`__
for the runtime which occurred on 2023-06-27.
For more information, see this `blog post <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/>`__.

Getting Started
---------------
Assuming that you have Python and ``virtualenv`` installed, set up your environment and install the required dependencies like this or you can install the library using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/boto/botocore.git
    $ cd botocore
    $ virtualenv venv
    ...
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -e .

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install botocore

Using Botocore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After installing botocore

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.aws/credentials``):

.. code-block:: ini

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET

Then, set up a default region (in e.g. ``~/.aws/config``):

.. code-block:: ini

   [default]
   region=us-east-1

Other credentials configuration method can be found `here <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>`__

Then, from a Python interpreter:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import botocore.session
    >>> session = botocore.session.get_session()
    >>> client = session.create_client('ec2')
    >>> print(client.describe_instances())
