The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
computing.

## Maintained versions

We maintain the **two most recently released major versions of Jupyter Notebook**,
Classic Notebook v6 and Notebook v7. Notebook v5 is no longer maintained.
All Notebook v5 users are strongly advised to upgrade to Classic Notebook v6 as soon as possible.

Upgrading to Notebook v7 may require more work, if you use custom extensions, as extensions written
for Notebook v5 or Classic Notebook v6 are not compatible with Notebook v7.

### Notebook v7

The newest major version of Notebook is based on:

- JupyterLab components for the frontend
- Jupyter Server for the Python server

This represents a significant change to the `jupyter/notebook` code base.

To learn more about Notebook v7: https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html

### Classic Notebook v6

Maintenance and security-related issues [only](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook-team-compass/issues/5#issuecomment-1085254000) are now being addressed in the [`6.5.x`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/6.5.x) branch.
It depends on [`nbclassic`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclassic) for the HTML/JavaScript/CSS assets.

New features and continuous improvement is now focused on Notebook v7 (see section above).

If you have an open pull request with a new feature or if you were planning to open one, we encourage switching over to the Jupyter Server and JupyterLab architecture, and distribute it as a server extension and / or JupyterLab prebuilt extension. That way your new feature will also be compatible with the new Notebook v7.

## Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook

Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for
Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of
The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic
release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _IPython notebook_,
and language specific code, such as the _IPython kernel for Python_. As
computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the
language-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the
community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own
discrete repos.

## Installation

You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/public-server.html).

## Development Installation

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up a local development installation.

## Contributing

## About the Jupyter Development Team

The Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.
This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:

## Our Copyright Policy

Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Jupyter repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

```
# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.
# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
