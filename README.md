The coverage improvement has increased from 40% to 100% as I wrote a test that has covered all branches. This is a maximal improvement.

Test 2

The coverage has improved from 16.66% to 66.66%. While the function was too complex to reach 80%, this is still a significant improvement

## Statement of individual contributions

For assignment 1, we encountered a lot of issues. Specifically practical ones, with being able to run the program properly. Thus, we all collaborated together on one computer. We assisted each other in the writing of the programs but took separate turns taking charge. We put the functions under Lodewijk’s name, as we were using his computer. But everyone was involved.

Ignacio led the structuring of tasks in assignment 2.
We all wrote one action, tested it and created a pull request. We also all checked each other’s work and commented on it, and helped each other through the process.
