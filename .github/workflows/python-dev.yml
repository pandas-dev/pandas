# This workflow may or may not run depending on the state of the next
# unreleased Python version. DO NOT DELETE IT.
#
# In general, this file will remain frozen(present, but not running) until:
#    - The next unreleased Python version has released beta 1
#      - This version should be available on GitHub Actions.
#    - Our required build/runtime dependencies(numpy, pytz, Cython, python-dateutil)
#      support that unreleased Python version.
#    To unfreeze, comment out the ``if: false`` condition, and make sure you update
#    the name of the workflow and Python version in actions/setup-python to: '3.12-dev'
#
# After it has been unfrozen, this file should remain unfrozen(present, and running) until:
#    - The next Python version has been officially released.
#    OR
#    - Most/All of our optional dependencies support Python 3.11 AND
#    - The next Python version has released a rc(we are guaranteed a stable ABI).
#    To freeze this file, uncomment out the ``if: false`` condition, and migrate the jobs
#    to the corresponding posix/windows-macos/sdist etc. workflows.
# Feel free to modify this comment as necessary.
